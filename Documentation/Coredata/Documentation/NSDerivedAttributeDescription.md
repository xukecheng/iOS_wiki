# derivationExpression

An expression for generating derived data.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.1+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var derivationExpression: NSExpression? { get set }

## Discussion

When using derived attributes in an SQL store, this expression should be

  * a keypath expression (including @operation components)

a function expression using one of the predefined functions defined in
`NSExpression`

Any keypaths used in the expression must be accessible from the entity on
which the derived attribute is specified.

If you try to add a store to a coordinator whose model contains derived
attributes of a type not supported by the store, the add fails and throws an
error.
