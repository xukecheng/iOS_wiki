## Discussion

The `signedPayload` is a string of three Base64URL-encoded components,
separated by a period. The string contains a JWS representation of the
notification response body, signed by the App Store according to the JSON Web
Signature (JWS) IETF RFC 7515 specification.

The three components of the string are a header, a payload, and a signature,
in that order.

To read the notification response body, Base64URL-decode the payload. Use a
`responseBodyV2DecodedPayload` object to read the payload information.

To read the header, Base64URL-decode it and use a `JWSDecodedHeader` object to
access the information. Use the information in the decoded header to verify
the signature.
