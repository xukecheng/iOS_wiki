    static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat

**Required**

##  Parameters

`context`

    

The context of the view that you apply the alignment guide to. The context
gives you the view’s dimensions, as well as the values of other alignment
guides that apply to the view, including both built-in and custom guides. You
can use any of these values, if helpful, to calculate the value for your
custom guide.

## Return Value

The offset of the guide from the origin in the view’s coordinate space.

## Discussion

Implement this method when you create a type that conforms to the
`AlignmentID` protocol. Use the method to calculate the default offset of the
corresponding alignment guide. SwiftUI interprets the value that you return as
an offset in the coordinate space of the view that’s being laid out. For
example, you can use the context to return a value that’s one-third of the
height of the view:

You can override the default value that this method returns for a particular
guide by adding the `alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)` view modifier to a
particular view.
