    func scrollTo<ID>(
        _ id: ID,
        anchor: UnitPoint? = nil
    ) where ID : Hashable

##  Parameters

`id`

    

The identifier of a child view to scroll to.

`anchor`

    

The alignment behavior of the scroll action.

## Discussion

If `anchor` is `nil`, this method finds the container of the identified view,
and scrolls the minimum amount to make the identified view wholly visible.

If `anchor` is non-`nil`, it defines the points in the identified view and the
scroll view to align. For example, setting `anchor` to `top` aligns the top of
the identified view to the top of the scroll view. Similarly, setting `anchor`
to `bottom` aligns the bottom of the identified view to the bottom of the
scroll view, and so on.
