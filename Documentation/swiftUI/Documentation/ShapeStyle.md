Type Method

# angularGradient(_:center:startAngle:endAngle:)

An angular gradient, which applies the color function as the angle changes
between the start and end angles, and anchored to a relative center point
within the filled shape.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    static func angularGradient(
        _ gradient: Gradient,
        center: UnitPoint,
        startAngle: Angle,
        endAngle: Angle
    ) -> AngularGradient

Available when `Self` is `AngularGradient`.

##  Parameters

`gradient`

    

The gradient to use for filling the shape, providing the colors and their
relative stop locations.

`center`

    

The relative center of the gradient, mapped from the unit space into the
bounding rectangle of the filled shape.

`startAngle`

    

The angle that marks the beginning of the gradient.

`endAngle`

    

The angle that marks the end of the gradient.

## Discussion

An angular gradient is also known as a “conic” gradient. If `endAngle -
startAngle > 2π`, the gradient only draws the last complete turn. If `endAngle
- startAngle < 2π`, the gradient fills the missing area with the colors
defined by gradient stop locations at `0` and `1`, transitioning between the
two halfway across the missing area.

For example, an angular gradient used as a background:

    ) -> EllipticalGradient

Available when `Self` is `EllipticalGradient`.

## Discussion

The gradient maps its coordinate space to the unit space square in which its
center and radii are defined, then stretches that square to fill its bounding
rect, possibly also stretching the circular gradient to have elliptical
contours.

For example, an elliptical gradient used as a background:

This hierarchical style maps to the first level of the current foreground
style, or to the first level of the default foreground style if you haven’t
set a foreground style in the view’s environment. You typically set a
foreground style by supplying a non-hierarchical style to the
`foregroundStyle(_:)` modifier.

## Discussion

For example:

On macOS and iPadOS this automatically reflects window key state and focus
state, where the emphasized appearance will be used only when the window is
key and the nearest focusable element is actually focused. On iPhone, this
will always fill with the environment’s accent color.

When applied as a background of another view, it will automatically set the
`EnvironmentValues.backgroundProminence` for the environment of that view to
match the current prominence of the selection.

This shape style is appropriate for items situated on top of an existing
background color. It incorporates transparency to allow the background color
to show through.

Use the primary version of this style to fill thin or small shapes, such as
the track of a slider on iOS. Use the secondary version of this style to fill
medium-size shapes, such as the background of a switch on iOS. Use the
tertiary version of this style to fill large shapes, such as input fields,
search bars, or buttons on iOS. Use the quaternary version of this style to
fill large areas that contain complex content, such as an expanded table cell
on iOS.

On macOS, this has a unique appearance compared to the default

wallpaper-tinted light gray in the light appearance and a wallpaper-tinted
dark gray in the dark appearance.

On visionOS, the default glass window background can only be created using
`glassBackgroundEffect`.

    func `in`(_ rect: CGRect) -> some ShapeStyle
    

##  Parameters

`rect`

    

A rectangle that gives the absolute coordinates over which to map the shape
style.

## Return Value

A new shape style mapped to the coordinates given by `rect`.

## Discussion

Some shape styles have colors or patterns that vary with position based on
`UnitPoint` coordinates. For example, you can create a `LinearGradient` using
`top` and `bottom` as the start and end points:

When rendering such styles, SwiftUI maps the unit space coordinates to the
absolute coordinates of the filled shape. However, you can tell SwiftUI to use
a different set of coordinates by supplying a rectangle to the `in(_:)`
method. Consider two resizable rectangles using the gradient defined above:

When `isBig` is true — defined elsewhere as a private `State` variable — the
rectangles look the same, because their heights match that of the modified
gradient:

When the user toggles `isBig` by tapping the `HStack`, the rectangles shrink,
but the gradients each react in a different way:

SwiftUI remaps the gradient of the first rectangle to the new frame height, so
that you continue to see the full range of colors in a smaller area. For the
second rectangle, the modified gradient retains a mapping to the full height,
so you instead see only a small part of the overall gradient. Animation helps
to visualize the difference.

## Discussion

For a `ShapeStyle` that also conforms to the `View` protocol, like `Color` or
`LinearGradient`, this default implementation of the `body` property provides
a visual representation for the shape style. As a result, you can use the
shape style in a view hierarchy like any other view:

# AngularGradient

An angular gradient.

    struct AngularGradient

## Overview

An angular gradient is also known as a “conic” gradient. This gradient applies
the color function as the angle changes, relative to a center point and
defined start and end angles. If `endAngle - startAngle > 2π`, the gradient
only draws the last complete turn. If `endAngle - startAngle < 2π`, the
gradient fills the missing area with the colors defined by gradient locations
one and zero, transitioning between the two halfway across the missing area.
The gradient maps the unit space center point into the bounding rectangle of
each shape filled with the gradient.

When using an angular gradient as a shape style, you can also use
`angularGradient(_:center:startAngle:endAngle:)`,
`conicGradient(_:center:angle:)`, or similar methods.

## Overview

The gradient maps its coordinate space to the unit space square in which its
center and radii are defined, then stretches that square to fill its bounding
rect, possibly also stretching the circular gradient to have elliptical
contours.

For example, an elliptical gradient centered on the view, filling its bounds:

When using an elliptical gradient as a shape style, you can also use
`ellipticalGradient(_:center:startRadiusFraction:endRadiusFraction:)`.

    struct Material

## Overview

You can apply a blur effect to a view that appears behind another view by
adding a material with the `background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:)` modifier:

In the example above, the `ZStack` layers a `Label` on top of the color
`teal`. The background modifier inserts the regular material below the label,
blurring the part of the background that the label — including its padding —
covers:

A material isn’t a view, but adding a material is like inserting a translucent
layer between the modified view and its background:

The blurring effect provided by the material isn’t simple opacity. Instead, it
uses a platform-specific blending that produces an effect that resembles
heavily frosted glass. You can see this more easily with a complex background,
like an image:

For physical materials, the degree to which the background colors pass through
depends on the thickness. The effect also varies with light and dark
appearance:

If you need a material to have a particular shape, you can use the
`background(_:in:fillStyle:)` modifier. For example, you can create a material
with rounded corners:

When you add a material, foreground elements exhibit vibrancy, a context-
specific blend of the foreground and background colors that improves contrast.
However using `foregroundStyle(_:)` to set a custom foreground style —
excluding the hierarchical styles, like `secondary` — disables vibrancy.

Note

A material blurs a background that’s part of your app, but not what appears
behind your app on the screen. For example, the content on the Home Screen
doesn’t affect the appearance of a widget.

## Topics

## Overview

You can set the tint color with the `tint(_:)` modifier. If no explicit tint
is set, the tint is derived from the app’s accent color.

You can also use `tint` to construct this style.
