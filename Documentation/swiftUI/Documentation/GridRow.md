    init(
        alignment: VerticalAlignment? = nil,
        @ViewBuilder content: () -> Content
    )

##  Parameters

`alignment`

    

An optional `VerticalAlignment` for the row. If you don’t specify a value, the
row uses the vertical alignment component of the `Alignment` parameter that
you specify in the grid’s
`init(alignment:horizontalSpacing:verticalSpacing:content:)` initializer,
which is `center` by default.

`content`

    

The builder closure that contains the child views. Each view in the closure
implicitly maps to a cell in the grid.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a `GridRow` inside of a `Grid`. Provide a
content closure that defines the cells of the row, and optionally customize
the vertical alignment of content within each cell. The following example
customizes the vertical alignment of the cells in the first and third rows:

The example above specifies `trailing` alignment for the grid, which is
composed of `center` vertical alignment and `trailing` horizontal alignment.
The middle row relies on the center vertical alignment, but the other two rows
specify custom vertical alignments:

Important

A grid row behaves like a `Group` if you create it outside of a grid.

To override column alignment, use `gridColumnAlignment(_:)`. To override
alignment for a single cell, use `gridCellAnchor(_:)`.
