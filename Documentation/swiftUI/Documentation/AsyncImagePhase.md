Instance Property

# image

The loaded image, if any.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var image: Image? { get }

## Discussion

If this value isnâ€™t `nil`, the image load operation has finished, and you can
use the image to update the view. You can use the image directly, or you can
modify it in some way. For example, you can add a
`resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)` modifier to make the image resizable.

Instance Property

# error

The error that occurred when attempting to load an image, if any.
