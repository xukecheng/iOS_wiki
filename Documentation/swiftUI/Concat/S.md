Type Method

# angularGradient(_:center:startAngle:endAngle:)

An angular gradient, which applies the color function as the angle changes
between the start and end angles, and anchored to a relative center point
within the filled shape.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    static func angularGradient(
        _ gradient: Gradient,
        center: UnitPoint,
        startAngle: Angle,
        endAngle: Angle
    ) -> AngularGradient

Available when `Self` is `AngularGradient`.

##  Parameters

`gradient`

    

The gradient to use for filling the shape, providing the colors and their
relative stop locations.

`center`

    

The relative center of the gradient, mapped from the unit space into the
bounding rectangle of the filled shape.

`startAngle`

    

The angle that marks the beginning of the gradient.

`endAngle`

    

The angle that marks the end of the gradient.

## Discussion

An angular gradient is also known as a “conic” gradient. If `endAngle -
startAngle > 2π`, the gradient only draws the last complete turn. If `endAngle
- startAngle < 2π`, the gradient fills the missing area with the colors
defined by gradient stop locations at `0` and `1`, transitioning between the
two halfway across the missing area.

For example, an angular gradient used as a background:

    ) -> EllipticalGradient

Available when `Self` is `EllipticalGradient`.

## Discussion

The gradient maps its coordinate space to the unit space square in which its
center and radii are defined, then stretches that square to fill its bounding
rect, possibly also stretching the circular gradient to have elliptical
contours.

For example, an elliptical gradient used as a background:

## Discussion

For example:

On macOS and iPadOS this automatically reflects window key state and focus
state, where the emphasized appearance will be used only when the window is
key and the nearest focusable element is actually focused. On iPhone, this
will always fill with the environment’s accent color.

When applied as a background of another view, it will automatically set the
`EnvironmentValues.backgroundProminence` for the environment of that view to
match the current prominence of the selection.

This shape style is appropriate for items situated on top of an existing
background color. It incorporates transparency to allow the background color
to show through.

Use the primary version of this style to fill thin or small shapes, such as
the track of a slider on iOS. Use the secondary version of this style to fill
medium-size shapes, such as the background of a switch on iOS. Use the
tertiary version of this style to fill large shapes, such as input fields,
search bars, or buttons on iOS. Use the quaternary version of this style to
fill large areas that contain complex content, such as an expanded table cell
on iOS.

    func `in`(_ rect: CGRect) -> some ShapeStyle
    

##  Parameters

`rect`

    

A rectangle that gives the absolute coordinates over which to map the shape
style.

## Return Value

A new shape style mapped to the coordinates given by `rect`.

## Discussion

Some shape styles have colors or patterns that vary with position based on
`UnitPoint` coordinates. For example, you can create a `LinearGradient` using
`top` and `bottom` as the start and end points:

When rendering such styles, SwiftUI maps the unit space coordinates to the
absolute coordinates of the filled shape. However, you can tell SwiftUI to use
a different set of coordinates by supplying a rectangle to the `in(_:)`
method. Consider two resizable rectangles using the gradient defined above:

When `isBig` is true — defined elsewhere as a private `State` variable — the
rectangles look the same, because their heights match that of the modified
gradient:

When the user toggles `isBig` by tapping the `HStack`, the rectangles shrink,
but the gradients each react in a different way:

SwiftUI remaps the gradient of the first rectangle to the new frame height, so
that you continue to see the full range of colors in a smaller area. For the
second rectangle, the modified gradient retains a mapping to the full height,
so you instead see only a small part of the overall gradient. Animation helps
to visualize the difference.

For a `ShapeStyle` that also conforms to the `View` protocol, like `Color` or
`LinearGradient`, this default implementation of the `body` property provides
a visual representation for the shape style. As a result, you can use the
shape style in a view hierarchy like any other view:

# AngularGradient

An angular gradient.

    struct AngularGradient

## Overview

An angular gradient is also known as a “conic” gradient. This gradient applies
the color function as the angle changes, relative to a center point and
defined start and end angles. If `endAngle - startAngle > 2π`, the gradient
only draws the last complete turn. If `endAngle - startAngle < 2π`, the
gradient fills the missing area with the colors defined by gradient locations
one and zero, transitioning between the two halfway across the missing area.
The gradient maps the unit space center point into the bounding rectangle of
each shape filled with the gradient.

When using an angular gradient as a shape style, you can also use
`angularGradient(_:center:startAngle:endAngle:)`,
`conicGradient(_:center:angle:)`, or similar methods.

## Overview

The gradient maps its coordinate space to the unit space square in which its
center and radii are defined, then stretches that square to fill its bounding
rect, possibly also stretching the circular gradient to have elliptical
contours.

For example, an elliptical gradient centered on the view, filling its bounds:

When using an elliptical gradient as a shape style, you can also use
`ellipticalGradient(_:center:startRadiusFraction:endRadiusFraction:)`.

    struct Material

## Overview

You can apply a blur effect to a view that appears behind another view by
adding a material with the `background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:)` modifier:

In the example above, the `ZStack` layers a `Label` on top of the color
`teal`. The background modifier inserts the regular material below the label,
blurring the part of the background that the label — including its padding —
covers:

A material isn’t a view, but adding a material is like inserting a translucent
layer between the modified view and its background:

The blurring effect provided by the material isn’t simple opacity. Instead, it
uses a platform-specific blending that produces an effect that resembles
heavily frosted glass. You can see this more easily with a complex background,
like an image:

For physical materials, the degree to which the background colors pass through
depends on the thickness. The effect also varies with light and dark
appearance:

If you need a material to have a particular shape, you can use the
`background(_:in:fillStyle:)` modifier. For example, you can create a material
with rounded corners:

When you add a material, foreground elements exhibit vibrancy, a context-
specific blend of the foreground and background colors that improves contrast.
However using `foregroundStyle(_:)` to set a custom foreground style —
excluding the hierarchical styles, like `secondary` — disables vibrancy.

Note

A material blurs a background that’s part of your app, but not what appears
behind your app on the screen. For example, the content on the Home Screen
doesn’t affect the appearance of a widget.

## Topics

# Scenes

Protocol

# Scene

A part of an app’s user interface with a life cycle managed by the system.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    protocol Scene

## Overview

You create an `App` by combining one or more instances that conform to the
`Scene` protocol in the app’s `body`. You can use the built-in scenes that
SwiftUI provides, like `WindowGroup`, along with custom scenes that you
compose from other scenes. To create a custom scene, declare a type that
conforms to the `Scene` protocol. Implement the required `body` computed
property and provide the content for your custom scene:

A scene acts as a container for a view hierarchy that you want to display to
the user. The system decides when and how to present the view hierarchy in the
user interface in a way that’s platform-appropriate and dependent on the
current state of the app. For example, for the window group shown above, the
system lets the user create or remove windows that contain `MyRootView` on
platforms like macOS and iPadOS. On other platforms, the same view hierarchy
might consume the entire display when active.

Read the `scenePhase` environment value from within a scene or one of its
views to check whether a scene is active or in some other state. You can
create a property that contains the scene phase, which is one of the values in
the `ScenePhase` enumeration, using the `Environment` attribute:

The `Scene` protocol provides scene modifiers, defined as protocol methods
with default implementations, that you use to configure a scene. For example,
you can use the `onChange(of:perform:)` modifier to trigger an action when a
value changes. The following code empties a cache when all of the scenes in
the window group have moved to the background:

## Topics

    enum ScenePhase

## Overview

The system moves your app’s `Scene` instances through phases that reflect a
scene’s operational state. You can trigger actions when the phase changes.
Read the current phase by observing the `scenePhase` value in the
`Environment`:

How you interpret the value depends on where it’s read from. If you read the
phase from inside a `View` instance, you obtain a value that reflects the
phase of the scene that contains the view. The following example uses the
`onChange(of:perform:)` method to enable a timer whenever the enclosing scene
enters the `ScenePhase.active` phase and disable the timer when entering any
other phase:

If you read the phase from within an `App` instance, you obtain an aggregate
value that reflects the phases of all the scenes in your app. The app reports
a value of `ScenePhase.active` if any scene is active, or a value of
`ScenePhase.inactive` when no scenes are active. This includes multiple scene
instances created from a single scene declaration; for example, from a
`WindowGroup`. When an app enters the `ScenePhase.background` phase, expect
the app to terminate soon after. You can use that opportunity to free any
resources:

If you read the phase from within a custom `Scene` instance, the value
similarly reflects an aggregation of all the scenes that make up the custom
scene:

# Settings

A scene that presents an interface for viewing and modifying an app’s
settings.

macOS 11.0+

    
    
    struct Settings<Content> where Content : View

## Overview

Use a settings scene to have SwiftUI manage views with controls for your app’s
settings when you declare your app using the `App` protocol. When you use an
`App` declaration for multiple platforms, compile the settings scene only in
macOS:

Passing a view as the argument to a settings scene in the `App` declaration
causes SwiftUI to enable the app’s Settings menu item. SwiftUI manages
displaying and removing the settings view when the user selects the Settings
item from the application menu or the equivalent keyboard shortcut:

The contents of your settings view are controls that modify bindings to
`UserDefaults` values that SwiftUI manages using the `AppStorage` property
wrapper:

You can define your settings in a single view, or you can use a `TabView` to
group settings into different collections:

# MenuBarExtra

A scene that renders itself as a persistent control in the system menu bar.

macOS 13.0+

    
    
    struct MenuBarExtra<Label, Content> where Label : View, Content : View

## Overview

Use a `MenuBarExtra` when you want to provide access to commonly used
functionality, even when your app is not active.

Or alternatively, to create a utility app that only shows in the menu bar.

An app that only shows in the menu bar will be automatically terminated if the
user removes the extra from the menu bar.

For apps that only show in the menu bar, a common behavior is for the app to
not display its icon in either the Dock or the application switcher. To enable
this behavior, set the `LSUIElement` flag in your app’s Information Property
List file to `true`.

For more complex or data rich menu bar extras, you can use the `window` style,
which displays a popover-like window from the menu bar icon that contains
standard controls. You define the layout and contents of those controls with
the content that you provide:

    init(
        duration: TimeInterval = 0.5,
        bounce: Double = 0.0
    )

##  Parameters

`duration`

    

Defines the pace of the spring. This is approximately equal to the settling
duration, but for springs with very large bounce values, will be the duration
of the period of oscillation for the spring.

`bounce`

    

How bouncy the spring should be. A value of 0 indicates no bounces (a
critically damped spring), positive values indicate increasing amounts of
bounciness up to a maximum of 1.0 (corresponding to undamped oscillation), and
negative values indicate overdamped springs with a minimum value of -1.0.

`stiffness`

    

The corresponding spring coefficient.

`damping`

    

Defines how the spring’s motion should be damped due to the forces of

## Discussion

The default mass is 1. Increasing this value will increase the spring’s
effect: the attached object will be subject to more oscillations and greater
overshoot, resulting in an increased settling duration. Decreasing the mass
will reduce the spring effect: there will be fewer oscillations and a reduced
overshoot, resulting in a decreased settling duration.

    func sizeThatFits(_ proposal: ProposedViewSize) -> CGSize

**Required** Default implementation provided.

##  Parameters

`proposal`

    

A size proposal for the container.

## Return Value

A size that indicates how much space the shape needs.

## Discussion

Implement this method to tell the container of the shape how much space the
shape needs to render itself, given a size proposal.

See `sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)` for more details about how the
layout system chooses the size of views.

# trim(from:to:)

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func trim(
        from startFraction: CGFloat = 0,
        to endFraction: CGFloat = 1
    ) -> some Shape
    

##  Parameters

`startFraction`

    

The fraction of the way through drawing this shape where drawing starts.

`endFraction`

    

The fraction of the way through drawing this shape where drawing ends.

## Return Value

A shape built by capturing a portion of this shape’s path.

## Discussion

To create a `Shape` instance, you define the shape’s path using lines and
curves. Use the `trim(from:to:)` method to draw a portion of a shape by
ignoring portions of the beginning and ending of the shape’s path.

For example, if you’re drawing a figure eight or infinity symbol (∞) starting
from its center, setting the `startFraction` and `endFraction` to different
values determines the parts of the overall shape.

The following example shows a simplified infinity symbol that draws only three
quarters of the full shape. That is, of the two lobes of the symbol, one lobe
is complete and the other is half complete.

Changing the parameters of `trim(from:to:)` to `.trim(from: 0, to: 1)` draws
the full infinity symbol, while `.trim(from: 0, to: 0.5)` draws only the left
lobe of the symbol.

Type Property

# role

An indication of how to style a shape.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    static var role: ShapeRole { get }

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Discussion

SwiftUI looks at a shape’s role when deciding how to apply a `ShapeStyle` at
render time. The `Shape` protocol provides a default implementation with a
value of `ShapeRole.fill`. If you create a composite shape, you can provide an
override of this property to return another value, if appropriate.

## Default Implementations

### Shape Implementations

`static var role: ShapeRole`

An indication of how to style a shape.

Instance Property

# layoutDirectionBehavior

Returns the behavior this shape should use for different layout directions.

iOS 17.0+  iPadOS 17.0+  macOS 14.0+  Mac Catalyst 17.0+  tvOS 17.0+  watchOS
10.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var layoutDirectionBehavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior { get }

**Required** Default implementation provided.

## Discussion

If the layoutDirectionBehavior for a Shape is one that mirrors, the shape’s
path will be mirrored horizontally when in the specified layout direction.
When mirrored, the individual points of the path will be transformed.

Defaults to `.mirrors` when deploying on iOS 17.0, macOS 14.0, tvOS 17.0,
watchOS 10.0 and later, and to `.fixed` if not. To mirror a path when
deploying to earlier releases, either use
`View.flipsForRightToLeftLayoutDirection` for a filled or stroked shape or
conditionally mirror the points in the path of the shape.

## Default Implementations

### Shape Implementations

`var layoutDirectionBehavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior`

Returns the behavior this shape should use for different layout directions.

Instance Method

# intersection(_:eoFill:)

    ) -> some Shape where T : Shape
    

##  Parameters

`other`

    

The shape to intersect.

`eoFill`

    

Whether to use the even-odd rule for determining which areas to treat as the
interior of the shapes (if true), or the non-zero rule (if false).

## Return Value

A new shape.

## Discussion

The filled region of the resulting shape is the overlapping area of the filled
region of both shapes. This can be used to clip the fill of a shape to a mask.

Any unclosed subpaths in either shape are assumed to be closed. The result of
filling this shape using either even-odd or non-zero fill rules is identical.

    func symmetricDifference<T>(
        _ other: T,
        eoFill: Bool = false
    ) -> some Shape where T : Shape
    

##  Parameters

`other`

    

The shape to difference.

`eoFill`

    

Whether to use the even-odd rule for determining which areas to treat as the
interior of the shapes (if true), or the non-zero rule (if false).

## Return Value

# Adding a search interface to your app

Present an interface that people can use to search for content in your app.

## Overview

Add a search interface to your app by applying one of the searchable view
modifiers — like `searchable(text:placement:prompt:)` — to a
`NavigationSplitView` or `NavigationStack`, or to a view inside one of these.
A search field then appears in the toolbar. The precise placement and
appearance of the search field depends on the platform, where you put the
modifier in code, and its configuration.

The searchable modifier that creates the field takes a `Binding` to a string
that represents the search field’s text. You provide the storage for the
string — and optionally for an array of discrete search tokens — that you use
to conduct the search. To learn about managing the search field’s data, see
Performing a search operation.

### Place the search field automatically

You can automatically place the search field by adding the
`searchable(text:placement:prompt:)` modifier to a navigation element like a
navigation split view:

With this configuration, the search field appears on the trailing edge of the
toolbar in macOS. In iOS and iPadOS, the first or second column displays the
search field in a double or triple column navigation view, respectively. The
above three-column example puts the search field at the top of the middle
column on iPad.

  * macOS 
  * iOS 

### Control the placement structurally

To add a search field to a specific column in iOS and iPadOS, add the
searchable modifier to a view in that column. For example, to indicate that
the search covers departments in the previous example, you could place the
search field in the first column by adding the modifier to that column’s
`DepartmentList` view instead of to the navigation split view:

### Control the placement programmatically

You can alternatively use the `placement` input parameter to suggest a
`SearchFieldPlacement` value for the search interface. For example, you can
achieve the same results as the previous example in macOS using the `sidebar`
placement:

If SwiftUI can’t satisfy the placement request, like when you ask for sidebar
placement in a searchable modifier that isn’t applied to a navigation split
view, SwiftUI relies instead on its automatic placement rules.

### Set a prompt for the search field

By default, the search field contains Search as the placeholder text, to
prompt people on how to use the field. You can customize the prompt by setting
either a string, a `Text` view, or a `LocalizedStringKey` for the searchable
modifier’s `prompt` input parameter. For example, you might use this to
clarify that the search field in the Department column searches among both
departments and the products in each department:

# Performing a search operation

Update search results based on search text and optional tokens that you store.

## Overview

To conduct a search in your app’s data model, create storage for the query
text and present it with a searchable view modifier. Because you manage the
storage, you can detect when it changes and update the search operation in
response. By updating search results as people type, you ensure that your
app’s search interface is responsive.

You can also optionally provide storage for tokens, which are discrete search
terms that your app recognizes. Tokens provide a way to combine multiple
search terms, and make it easier for you to indicate that a search term is
common or expected in your app.

For information on how to control the placement of the search field in your
app’s interface, see Adding a search interface to your app.

### Provide storage for a string

The searchable modifiers take a `Binding` to a string value for the `text`
input. The string serves as the storage for the search query field that
SwiftUI displays. You can create this storage inside a view using a `State`
property, and initialize it to an empty string:

To make it easier to share the search query among different views, you can
create a published value inside an observable object that’s part of your app’s
model:

In either case, pass a `Binding` to this string into the searchable view
modifier by adding the dollar sign (`$`) prefix to the value:

### Provide storage for tokens

In addition to a search string, the search field can also display tokens when
you use one of the searchable modifiers that has a `tokens` parameter, like
`searchable(text:tokens:placement:prompt:token:)`.

You create tokens by defining a group of values that conform to the
`Identifiable` protocol, then instantiate the collection of values. For
example you can create an enumeration of fruit tokens:

Then add a new published property to your model to store a collection of
tokens:

To display tokens, provide a `Binding` to the `tokens` array as the searchable
modifier’s `tokens` input parameter, and describe how to draw each token using
the `token` closure. From the closure, return the `View` that represents the
token given as an input. For example, you can use a `Text` view to represent
each token:

You can represent the token with a `Text` view, as the above example
demonstrates. In iOS and iPadOS, you can use a `Label` instead. Ensure the
view clearly represents the corresponding search query, and if you use a
label, that the tokens fit the search query field’s height. Tokens appear at
the beginning of the search field before any plain text. The following shows
how the search field looks when the `tokens` array contains the `apple` and
`banana` tokens:

### Support tokens that have a mutable component

You can enable people to mutate part of the data that represents a token by
using a `Picker` in the `token` closure. For example, suppose you have fruit
token data that contains both a kind and a hydration property:

With your new model, specify a `Binding` to the token in the `token` closure
by adding a dollar sign (`$`). Use the binding to create a picker for the
`hydration` property and a label that uses the `kind` property:

### Add tokens to the search

Provide a way for people to add tokens to the search field. You can do this in
different ways. For example, you can:

  * Suggest tokens to add to the array by using one of the searchable view modifiers that have a `suggestedTokens` input parameter, like `searchable(text:tokens:suggestedTokens:placement:prompt:token:)`. People select suggestions from a list that appears below the search field. For more information about offering suggestions for tokens, as well as for search text, see Suggesting search terms.

  * Monitor the search string as people edit it. When you detect a substring that matches one of the tokens, convert the text into a token by removing the relevant characters from the string and add the corresponding token to the `tokens` array.

  * Wait until you see a dividing character in the search string, like a comma or a space, and then attempt to tokenize the preceding characters.

  * Wait until someone submits the search, and then attempt to tokenize the entire search string. For more information about submitting a search, see Managing search interface activation.

### Conduct the search

When you detect changes in the search query, your app can begin a search. How
you perform the search operation depends on how your app stores and presents
data. One approach is to filter the elements that appear in a `List` based on
whether a field in the list’s items matches the search query. For example, you
can create a method that returns only the items in an array of products with
names that match the search text or one of the tokens currently in the search
field:

Consider the complexity of the search and the cost of changing the search
terms. If the cost is high, like when updates require network access, or for
complex filter logic, consider prefetching and caching data or reducing the
frequency of updates. Alternatively, you can wait until someone submits the
query before conducting the search. For information about detecting query
submission, see Managing search interface activation.

If the search space can be broken into broad categories, you can help people
narrow the search more quickly by providing a scope. See Scoping a search
operation.

# Suggesting search terms

Provide suggestions to people searching for content in your app.

## Overview

You can suggest query text during a search operation by providing a collection
of search suggestion views. Because suggestion views are not limited to plain
text, you must also provide the search string that each suggestion view
represents. You can also provide suggestions for tokens, if your search
interface includes them. SwiftUI presents the suggestions in a list below the
search field.

For both text and tokens, you manage the list of suggestions, so you have
complete flexibility to decide what to suggest. For example, you can:

  * Offer a static list of suggestions.

  * Remember previous searches and offer the most recent or most common ones.

  * Update the list of suggestions in real time based on the current search text.

  * Employ some combination of these and other strategies, possibly changing over time.

### Suggest search text

Suggest search text by providing a collection of views to the
`searchSuggestions(_:)` view modifier. This modifier applies to the
`searchable(text:placement:prompt:)` modifier that appears before it.

When someone activates the search interface, it presents the suggestion views
as a list of choices below the query string. Associate a string with each
suggestion view by adding the `searchCompletion(_:)` modifier to the view
inside the search suggestions closure. For example, you can include emoji with
fruit types that you suggest as possible products to search for, and provide
the corresponding search string as a search completion in each case:

When someone chooses a suggestion, SwiftUI replaces the text in the search
field with the search completion string. In the above example, choosing “🍐
Pear” puts the text “pear” in the search query.

If you omit the search completion modifier for a particular suggestion view,
SwiftUI displays the view, but the view doesn’t react to taps or clicks.
However, you can group the views with `Section` containers that have headers,
enabling you to distinguish different kinds of suggestions, like recent
searches and common search terms.

Important

In tvOS, searchable modifiers only support suggestion views of type `Text`,
like in the above example. Other platforms can use arbitrary views for the
suggestions, including custom views.

Certain events or actions, like when someone moves a macOS window, might
dismiss the suggestion list.

### Suggest tokens

You can also suggest tokens for the search field. In this case, associate a
suggestion view with a token using the version of the `searchCompletion(_:)`
modifier that takes tokens as input:

You can use any type that conforms to the `Identifiable` protocol as a token.
For more information about using tokens in the search query, see Performing a
search operation.

### Simplify token suggestions

As a convenience when you have a collection of suggestions that exactly
matches the list of tokens, you can create a collection of possible tokens to
suggest. For example, you can add a published `suggestions` property to your
model that contains all the possible tokens:

Then you can provide this array to one of the searchable modifiers that takes
a `suggestedTokens` input parameter, like
`searchable(text:tokens:suggestedTokens:placement:prompt:token:)`. SwiftUI
uses this to generate the suggestions automatically:

In this version of the searchable modifier, SwiftUI uses one view builder to
describe the appearance of the tokens in both the search field and the
suggestions container.

### Update suggestions dynamically

You can update the suggestions that you provide as conditions change. For
example, you can specify an array of `suggestedSearches` that you store in
your app’s model:

If `suggestedSearches` begins as an empty array, the interface doesn’t display
any suggestions to start. You can then update the array as conditions change,
like when you want to include previous searches.

    func searchSuggestions<S>(@ViewBuilder _ suggestions: () -> S) -> some View where S : View
    

##  Parameters

`suggestions`

    

A view builder that produces content that populates a list of suggestions.

## Discussion

You can suggest search terms during a search operation by providing a
collection of view to this modifier. The interface presents the suggestion
views as a list of choices when someone activates the search interface.
Associate a string with each suggestion view by adding the
`searchCompletion(_:)` modifier to the view. For example, you can suggest
fruit types by displaying their emoji, and provide the corresponding search
string as a search completion in each case:

When someone chooses a suggestion, SwiftUI replaces the text in the search
field with the search completion string. If you omit the search completion
modifier for a particular suggestion view, SwiftUI displays the suggestion,
but the suggestion view doesn’t react to taps or clicks.

Important

In tvOS, searchable modifiers only support suggestion views of type `Text`,
like in the above example. Other platforms can use any view for the
suggestions, including custom views.

You can update the suggestions that you provide as conditions change.

For example, you can specify an array of suggestions that you store in a
model:

If the model’s `suggestedSearches` begins as an empty array, the interface
doesn’t display any suggestions to start. You can then provide logic that
updates the array based on some condition. For example, you might update the
completions based on the current search text. Note that certain events or
actions, like when someone moves a macOS window, might dismiss the suggestion
view.

9.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func searchSuggestions(
        _ visibility: Visibility,
        for placements: SearchSuggestionsPlacement.Set
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`visibility`

    

The visibility of the search suggestions for the specified locations.

`placements`

    

The set of locations in which to set the visibility of search suggestions.

## Discussion

SwiftUI presents search suggestions differently depending on several factors,
like the platform, the position of the search field, and the size class. Use
this modifier when you want to only display suggestions in certain ways under
certain conditions. For example, you might choose to display suggestions in a
menu when possible, but directly filter your data source otherwise.

## Overview

You can influence which modes SwiftUI displays search suggestions for by using
the `searchSuggestions(_:for:)` modifier:

In the above example, SwiftUI only displays search suggestions in a
suggestions menu. You might want to do this when you want to render search
suggestions in a container, like inline with your own set of search results.

You can get the current search suggestion placement by querying the
`searchSuggestionsPlacement` environment value in your search suggestions.

## Topics

### Getting placements

`static var automatic: SearchSuggestionsPlacement`

Search suggestions render automatically based on the surrounding context.

`static var content: SearchSuggestionsPlacement`

Search suggestions render in the main content of the app.

`static var menu: SearchSuggestionsPlacement`

# Scoping a search operation

Divide the search space into a few broad categories.

## Overview

If the data you want to search falls into a few categories, you can define
different scopes to help people narrow their search. When you define a scope,
SwiftUI presents a picker that people can use to choose one of them. You then
use the current scope selection as one of the inputs to the search operation.

### Define the possible scopes

Start by creating a type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol to represent
the possible scopes. For example, you can use an enumeration to scope a
product search to just fruits or just vegetables:

Then create a property to store the current scope, either as a state variable
in a view, or a published property in your model:

### Apply the scope

To use the scope information, bind the current scope to the
`searchScopes(_:scopes:)` modifier. You also indicate a set of views that
correspond to the different scopes. Like the `searchSuggestions(_:)` modifier,
the scopes modifier operates on the searchable modifier that’s closer to the
modified view, so it needs to follow the searchable modifier:

SwiftUI uses the binding and views to add a `Picker` to the search field. By
default, the picker appears below the search field in macOS when search is
active, or in iOS when someone starts entering text into the search field:

  * macOS 
  * iOS 

You can change when the picker appears by using the
`searchScopes(_:activation:_:)` modifier instead, and supplying one of the
`SearchScopeActivation` values, like `onTextEntry` or `onSearchPresentation`.

To ensure that the picker operates correctly, match the type of the scope
binding with the type of each view’s tag. In the above example, both the
`scope` input and the tags for each view have the type `ProductScope`.

### Use the scope in your search

Modify your search to account for the current value of the `scope` property,
if you offer it, along with the text and tokens in the query. For example, you
might include the scope as one element of a predicate that you define for a
Core Data fetch request. For more information about conducting a search, see
Performing a search operation.

##  Parameters

`scope`

    

The active scope of the search field.

`scopes`

    

A view builder that represents the scoping options SwiftUI uses to populate a
`Picker`.

## Discussion

To enable people to narrow the scope of their searches, you can create a type
that represents the possible scopes, and then create a state variable to hold
the current selection. For example, you can scope the product search to just
fruits or just vegetables:

Provide a binding to the scope, as well as a view that represents each scope:

SwiftUI uses this binding and view to add a `Picker` with the search field. In
iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS, the picker appears below the search field when
search is active. To ensure that the picker operates correctly, match the type
of the scope binding with the type of each view’s tag. Then modify your search
to account for the current value of the `scope` state property.

By default, the appearance of scopes varies by platform:

  * In iOS and iPadOS, search scopes appear when someone enters text into the search field and disappear when someone cancels the search.

  * In macOS, search scopes appear when SwiftUI presents search and disappear when someone cancels the search.

However, you can use the `activation` parameter with a value of `onTextEntry`
or `onSearchPresentation` to configure this behavior:

# Managing search interface activation

Programmatically detect and dismiss a search field.

## Overview

People activate a search field in your app by tapping or clicking it, after
which they can enter search terms. In many cases, your app only needs to react
to the corresponding changes in the search text values, which the interface
updates through the binding that you provide, as described in Performing a
search operation.

However, SwiftUI also provides controls that enable you to programmatically
manage the search interface. In particular, you can:

  * Activate or deactivate the interface using a binding that you provide to the searchable modifier.

  * Detect whether the interface is active by reading an environment value.

  * Dismiss the interface by calling an action stored in the environment.

  * Wait for a search submission event before starting to search.

### Control activation through a binding

You can control search interface activation programmatically by providing the
searchable modifier’s `isPresented` parameter with a `Binding` to a Boolean
value. For example, to present a sheet that appears with the search interface
already active, create a binding that starts as true:

On iOS and macOS, SwiftUI focuses the search field when presenting search and
unfocuses the search field when dismissing search. The search field can also
lose focus while the search interface remains presented. For example, if your
search interface contains a list of text fields, someone might move focus to
one of the text fields without dismissing the interface.

### Detect search activation

If you need to know when the search interface is active, you can query the
environment’s `isSearching` property using the `Environment` property wrapper.
The following example shows a view that updates the text it displays based on
the state of the property:

When someone first taps or clicks in a search field, the `isSearching`
property becomes `true`. When they cancel or submit the search operation, the
property becomes `false`. It also becomes `false` if you programmatically
dismiss the interface, as the next section describes.

Be sure to read the property from inside a view that’s wrapped, either
directly or indirectly, by one of the `searchable(text:placement:prompt:)`
view modifiers, like `SearchedView` in the above example. You won’t detect any
change in the property value if you read it from outside of that context, like
if you put it in the `SearchingExample` view.

### Dismiss the search interface

You can programmatically deactivate the interface using the environment’s
`dismissSearch` action. For example, consider a view with a `Button` that
presents more information about the first matching item from a collection:

The button becomes visible only after someone enters search text that produces
a match. The button’s action shows a sheet that provides more information
about the item, including an Add button for adding the item to a stored list
of items:

People can dismiss the sheet by dragging it down, effectively canceling the
operation, leaving the in-progress search interaction intact. Alternatively,
They can tap the Add button to store the item. Because people are likely done
with both the detail view and the search interaction at this point, the
button’s closure uses the `dismiss` property to dismiss the sheet, and the
`dismissSearch` property to reset the search field.

As with the `isSearching` property, be sure to only read `dismissSearch` from
within the hierarchy of a searchable view modifier. Calling the action has no
effect if you read it from the environment outside of that context. The above
example reads the action from `SearchedView`, and passes that into the sheet,
because the sheet has its own environment. The action also has no effect if
the search interface isn’t active.

### React to search submission

To specify an action that SwiftUI invokes when someone submits the search
query (by pressing the Return key), add the `onSubmit(of:_:)` modifier:

Depending your app’s structure, you can use search submission in different
ways. For example, you can take that opportunity to look for substrings among
the search query string that you can convert into tokens. Alternatively, for a
search operation that’s very slow, perhaps because it requires a network
access, you can wait for a submission event before performing a search.

Instance Property

# isSearching

A Boolean value that indicates when the user is searching.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var isSearching: Bool { get }

## Discussion

You can read this value like any of the other `EnvironmentValues`, by creating
a property with the `Environment` property wrapper:

Get the value to find out when the user interacts with a search field that’s
produced by one of the searchable modifiers, like
`searchable(text:placement:prompt:)`:

When the user first taps or clicks in a search field, the `isSearching`
property becomes `true`. When the user cancels the search operation, the
property becomes `false`. To programmatically set the value to `false` and
dismiss the search operation, use `dismissSearch`.

Important

Access the value from inside the searched view, as the example above
demonstrates, rather than from the searched view’s parent. SwiftUI sets the
value in the environment of the view that you apply the searchable modifier
to, and doesn’t propagate the value up the view hierarchy.

Instance Property

# dismissSearch

An action that ends the current search interaction.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var dismissSearch: DismissSearchAction { get }

## Discussion

Use this environment value to get the `DismissSearchAction` instance for the
current `Environment`. Then call the instance to dismiss the current search
interaction. You call the instance directly because it defines a
`callAsFunction()` method that Swift calls when you call the instance.

When you dismiss search, SwiftUI:

  * Sets `isSearching` to `false`.

  * Clears any text from the search field.

  * Removes focus from the search field.

Note

Calling this instance has no effect if the user isn’t interacting with a
search field.

Use this action to dismiss a search operation based on another user
interaction. For example, consider a searchable view with a `Button` that
presents more information about the first matching item from a collection:

The button becomes visible only after the user enters search text that
produces a match. When the user taps the button, SwiftUI shows a sheet that
provides more information about the item, including an Add button for adding
the item to a stored list of items:

People can dismiss the sheet by dragging it down, effectively canceling the
operation, leaving the in-progress search interaction intact. Alternatively,
people can tap the Add button to store the item. Because the person using your
app is likely to be done with both the detail view and the search interaction
at this point, the button’s closure also uses the `dismiss` property to
dismiss the sheet, and the `dismissSearch` property to reset the search field.

Important

Access the action from inside the searched view, as the example above
demonstrates, rather than from the searched view’s parent, or another
hierarchy, like that of a sheet. SwiftUI sets the value in the environment of
the view that you apply the searchable modifier to, and doesn’t propagate the
value up the view hierarchy.

Structure

# DismissSearchAction

An action that can end a search interaction.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    struct DismissSearchAction

## Overview

Use the `dismissSearch` environment value to get the instance of this
structure for a given `Environment`. Then call the instance to dismiss the
current search interaction. You call the instance directly because it defines
a `callAsFunction()` method that Swift calls when you call the instance.

When you dismiss search, SwiftUI:

  * Sets `isSearching` to `false`.

  * Clears any text from the search field.

  * Removes focus from the search field.

Note

Calling this instance has no effect if the user isn’t interacting with a
search field.

Use this action to dismiss a search operation based on another user
interaction. For example, consider a searchable view with a `Button` that
presents more information about the first matching item from a collection:

The button becomes visible only after the user enters search text that
produces a match. When the user taps the button, SwiftUI shows a sheet that
provides more information about the item, including an Add button for adding
the item to a stored list of items:

People can dismiss the sheet by dragging it down, effectively canceling the
operation, leaving the in-progress search interaction intact. Alternatively,
people can tap the Add button to store the item. Because the person using your
app is likely to be done with both the detail view and the search interaction
at this point, the button’s closure also uses the `dismiss` property to
dismiss the sheet, and the `dismissSearch` property to reset the search field.

Important

Access the action from inside the searched view, as the example above
demonstrates, rather than from the searched view’s parent, or another
hierarchy, like that of a sheet. SwiftUI sets the value in the environment of
the view that you apply the searchable modifier to, and doesn’t propagate the
value up the view hierarchy.

Instance Method

# findNavigator(isPresented:)

Programmatically presents the find and replace interface for text editor
views.

iOS 16.0+  iPadOS 16.0+  Mac Catalyst 16.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func findNavigator(isPresented: Binding<Bool>) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`isPresented`

    

A binding to a Boolean value that controls the presentation of the find and
replace interface.

## Return Value

A view that presents the find and replace interface when `isPresented` is
`true`.

## Discussion

Add this modifier to a `TextEditor`, or to a view hierarchy that contains at
least one text editor, to control the presentation of the find and replace
interface. When you set the `isPresented` binding to `true`, the system shows
the interface, and when you set it to `false`, the system hides the interface.
The following example shows and hides the interface based on the state of a
toolbar button:

The find and replace interface allows people to search for instances of a
specified string in the text editor, and optionally to replace instances of
the search string with another string. They can also show and hide the
interface using built-in controls, like menus and keyboard shortcuts. SwiftUI
updates `isPresented` to reflect the users’s actions.

If the text editor view isn’t currently in focus, the system still presents
the find and replace interface when you set `isPresented` to `true`. If the
view hierarchy contains multiple editors, the one that shows the find and
replace interface is nondeterministic.

You can disable the find and replace interface for a text editor by applying
the `findDisabled(_:)` modifier to the editor. If you do that, setting this
modifier’s `isPresented` binding to `true` has no effect, but only if the
disabling modifier appears closer to the text editor, like this:

## See Also

### Searching for text in a view with find and replace

`func findDisabled(Bool) -> some View`

Prevents find and replace operations in a text editor.

`func replaceDisabled(Bool) -> some View`

Prevents replace operations in a text editor.

Instance Method

# findDisabled(_:)

Prevents find and replace operations in a text editor.

iOS 16.0+  iPadOS 16.0+  Mac Catalyst 16.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func findDisabled(_ isDisabled: Bool = true) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`isDisabled`

    

A Boolean value that indicates whether to disable the find and replace
interface for a text editor.

## Return Value

A view that disables the find and replace interface.

## Discussion

Add this modifier to ensure that people can’t activate the find and replace
interface for a `TextEditor`:

When you disable the find operation, you also implicitly disable the replace
operation. If you want to only disable replace, use `replaceDisabled(_:)`
instead.

Using this modifer also prevents programmatic find and replace interface
presentation using the `findNavigator(isPresented:)` method. Be sure to place
the disabling modifier closer to the text editor for this to work:

If you apply this modifer at multiple levels of a view hierarchy, the call
closest to the text editor takes precedence. For example, people can activate
find and replace for the first text editor in the following example, but not
the second:

    func replaceDisabled(_ isDisabled: Bool = true) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`isDisabled`

    

A Boolean value that indicates whether text replacement in the find and
replace interface is disabled.

## Return Value

A view that disables the replace feature of a find and replace interface.

## Discussion

Add this modifier to ensure that people can’t activate the replace feature of
a find and replace interface for a `TextEditor`:

If you want to disable both find and replace, use the `findDisabled(_:)`
modifier instead.

Using this modifer also disables the replace feature of a find and replace
interface that you present programmatically using the
`findNavigator(isPresented:)` method. Be sure to place the disabling modifier
closer to the text editor for this to work:

If you apply this modifer at multiple levels of a view hierarchy, the call
closest to the text editor takes precedence. For example, people can activate
find and replace for the first text editor in the following example, but only
find for the second:

show the label, but even in those cases, SwiftUI uses the label for
accessibility. For example, VoiceOver uses the label to identify the purpose
of the slider.

## Discussion

The `value` of the created instance is equal to the position of the given
value within `bounds`, mapped into `0...1`.

The slider calls `onEditingChanged` when editing begins and ends. For example,
on iOS, editing begins when the user starts to drag the thumb along the
slider’s track.

    struct Section

## Overview

Examine a `Section` instance to find the entities that satisfy a
`SectionedFetchRequest` predicate, and that have a particular property with
the value stored in the section’s `id` parameter. You specify which property
by setting the fetch request’s `sectionIdentifier` parameter during
initialization, or by modifying the corresponding `SectionedFetchResults`
instance’s `sectionIdentifier` property.

Obtain specific sections by treating the fetch results as a collection. For
example, consider the following property declaration that fetches `Quake`
managed objects that the Loading and Displaying a Large Data Feed sample code
project defines to store earthquake data:

Get the first section using a subscript:

Alternatively, you can loop over the sections to create a list of sections.

The sections also act as collections, which means you can use elements like
the `count` property in the example above.

## Topics

### Identifying the section

`let id: SectionIdentifier`

The value that all entities in the section share for a specified key path.

### Getting indices

`var startIndex: Int`

Instance Method

# userActivity(_:element:_:)

Advertises a user activity type.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func userActivity<P>(
        _ activityType: String,
        element: P?,
        _ update: @escaping (P, NSUserActivity) -> ()
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`activityType`

    

The type of activity to advertise.

`element`

    

If the element is `nil`, the handler will not be associated with the activity
(and if there are no handlers, no activity is advertised). The method passes
the non-`nil` element to the handler as a convenience so the handlers don’t
all need to implement an early exit with `guard element = element else {
return }`.

`update`

    

A function that modifies the passed-in activity for advertisement.

## Discussion

The scope of the activity applies only to the scene or window the view is in.

        isActive: Bool = true,
        _ update: @escaping (NSUserActivity) -> ()
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`activityType`

    

The type of activity to advertise.

`isActive`

    

When `false`, avoids advertising the activity. Defaults to `true`.

`update`

    

A function that modifies the passed-in activity for advertisement.

## Discussion

You can use `userActivity(_:isActive:_:)` to start, stop, or modify the
advertisement of a specific type of user activity.

    func onContinueUserActivity(
        _ activityType: String,
        perform action: @escaping (NSUserActivity) -> ()
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`activityType`

    

The type of activity that the `action` closure handles. Be sure that this
string matches one of the values that you list in the `NSUserActivityTypes`
array in your app’s Information Property List.

`action`

    

A closure that SwiftUI calls when your app receives a user activity of the
specified type. The closure takes the activity as an input parameter.

## Return Value

A view that handles incoming user activities.

## Discussion

Use this view modifier to receive `NSUserActivity` instances in a particular
scene within your app. The scene that SwiftUI routes the incoming user
activity to depends on the structure of your app, what scenes are active, and
other configuration. For more information, see
`handlesExternalEvents(matching:)`.

UI frameworks traditionally pass Universal Links to your app using a user
activity. However, SwiftUI passes a Universal Link to your app directly as a
URL. To receive a Universal Link, use the `onOpenURL(perform:)` modifier
instead.

# openURL

An action that opens a URL.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var openURL: OpenURLAction { get set }

## Discussion

Read this environment value to get an `OpenURLAction` instance for a given
`Environment`. Call the instance to open a URL. You call the instance directly
because it defines a `callAsFunction(_:)` method that Swift calls when you
call the instance.

For example, you can open a web site when the user taps a button:

If you want to know whether the action succeeds, add a completion handler that
takes a Boolean value. In this case, Swift implicitly calls the
`callAsFunction(_:completion:)` method instead. That method calls your
completion handler after it determines whether it can open the URL, but
possibly before it finishes opening the URL. You can add a handler to the
example above so that it prints the outcome to the console:

The system provides a default open URL action with behavior that depends on
the contents of the URL. For example, the default action opens a Universal
Link in the associated app if possible, or in the user’s default web browser
if not.

You can also set a custom action using the `environment(_:_:)` view modifier.
Any views that read the action from the environment, including the built-in
`Link` view and `Text` views with markdown links, or links in attributed
strings, use your action. Initialize an action by calling the `init(handler:)`
initializer with a handler that takes a URL and returns an
`OpenURLAction.Result`:

SwiftUI translates the value that your custom action’s handler returns into an
appropriate Boolean result for the action call. For example, a view that uses
the action declared above receives `true` when calling the action, because the
handler always returns `handled`.

    struct OpenURLAction

## Overview

Read the `openURL` environment value to get an instance of this structure for
a given `Environment`. Call the instance to open a URL. You call the instance
directly because it defines a `callAsFunction(_:)` method that Swift calls
when you call the instance.

For example, you can open a web site when the user taps a button:

If you want to know whether the action succeeds, add a completion handler that
takes a Boolean value. In this case, Swift implicitly calls the
`callAsFunction(_:completion:)` method instead. That method calls your
completion handler after it determines whether it can open the URL, but
possibly before it finishes opening the URL. You can add a handler to the
example above so that it prints the outcome to the console:

The system provides a default open URL action with behavior that depends on
the contents of the URL. For example, the default action opens a Universal
Link in the associated app if possible, or in the user’s default web browser
if not.

You can also set a custom action using the `environment(_:_:)` view modifier.
Any views that read the action from the environment, including the built-in
`Link` view and `Text` views with markdown links, or links in attributed
strings, use your action. Initialize an action by calling the `init(handler:)`
initializer with a handler that takes a URL and returns an
`OpenURLAction.Result`:

SwiftUI translates the value that your custom action’s handler returns into an
appropriate Boolean result for the action call. For example, a view that uses
the action declared above receives `true` when calling the action, because the
handler always returns `handled`.

## Topics

### Creating the action

`init(handler: (URL) -> OpenURLAction.Result)`

Creates an action that opens a URL.

`struct Result`

The result of a custom open URL action.

### Calling the action

`func callAsFunction(URL)`

Opens a URL, following system conventions.

`func callAsFunction(URL, completion: (Bool) -> Void)`

Asynchronously opens a URL, following system conventions.

### Sending and receiving URLs

`var openURL: OpenURLAction`

An action that opens a URL.

`func onOpenURL(perform: (URL) -> ()) -> some View`

Registers a handler to invoke in response to a URL that your app receives.

Instance Method

# onOpenURL(perform:)

Registers a handler to invoke in response to a URL that your app receives.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func onOpenURL(perform action: @escaping (URL) -> ()) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`action`

    

A closure that SwiftUI calls when your app receives a Universal Link or a
custom `URL`. The closure takes the URL as an input parameter.

## Return Value

A view that handles incoming URLs.

## Discussion

Use this view modifier to receive URLs in a particular scene within your app.
The scene that SwiftUI routes the incoming URL to depends on the structure of
your app, what scenes are active, and other configuration. For more
information, see `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)`.

UI frameworks traditionally pass Universal Links to your app using an
`NSUserActivity`. However, SwiftUI passes a Universal Link to your app
directly as a URL, which you receive using this modifier. To receive other
user activities, like when your app participates in Handoff, use the
`onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)` modifier instead.

For more information about linking into your app, see Allowing apps and
websites to link to your content.

Instance Method

# handlesExternalEvents(matching:)

Specifies the external events for which SwiftUI opens a new instance of the
modified scene.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func handlesExternalEvents(matching conditions: Set<String>) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`conditions`

    

A set of strings that SwiftUI compares against the incoming user activity or
URL to see if SwiftUI can open a new scene instance to handle the external
event.

## Return Value

A scene type that limits the kinds of external events for which SwiftUI opens
a new instance.

## Discussion

When your app receives an external event like a user activity or a URL,
SwiftUI routes the event to a scene for processing. SwiftUI selects the scene
that receives the event according to the following rules, which it evaluates
in order until it finds a destination scene:

  * On platforms that support only a single scene per app, send the event to the one open scene.

  * Find an open scene that indicates it prefers to or can handle the event, if any, and send the event to that scene. You use the `handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)` view modifier on a view inside the scene to register this preference.

  * Find a scene declaration with a `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` scene modifier containing `conditions` that match the external event. Create a new instance of the first scene that matches and route the event there.

  * Find the first scene declaration that doesn’t have the scene modifier. Create a new instance of this scene and route the event there.

Make sure that at least one of these rules succeeds in your app for all events
that your app claims to handle. Also, make sure that the scene that receives
an event actually handles it. For example, be sure that a scene that receives
user activities handles them with an appropriate
`onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)` view modifier.

Don’t confuse the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` scene modifier with the
`handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)` _view_ modifier. You use the
scene modifier to help SwiftUI choose a new scene to open when no open scene
handles an external event, whereas you use the view modifier to indicate that
an open scene can or prefers to handle certain events.

### Matching an event

To find a scene type that handles a particular external event, SwiftUI
compares a property of the event against the strings that you specify in the
`conditions` set. SwiftUI examines the following event properties to perform
the comparison:

  * For an `NSUserActivity`, like when your app handles Handoff, SwiftUI uses the activity’s `targetContentIdentifier` property, or if that’s `nil`, its `webpageURL` property rendered as an `absoluteString`.

  * For a `URL`, like when another process opens a URL that your app handles, SwiftUI uses the URL’s `absoluteString`.

An empty set of strings never matches. Similarly, empty strings never match.
Conversely, as a special case, the string that contains only an asterisk (`*`)
matches anything. The modifier performs string comparisons that are case and
diacritic insensitive.

Important

`DocumentGroup` scenes ignore this modifier. Instead, document scenes decide
whether to open a new scene to handle an external event by comparing the
incoming URL or user activity’s `webpageURL` against the document group’s
supported types.

### Choosing a window to open

The following example shows an app with a photo browser scene that displays a
collection of photos, and a photo detail scene that enables closer examination
of a particular photo:

The app uses the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` modifier on the second
scene to ensure that an external event with an identifier that contains the
string `photoIdentifier=` creates a new scene of the second type. Other
events, if not handled by an open scene, cause the creation of a new browser
window instead.

### Handling external events

`func handlesExternalEvents(preferring: Set<String>, allowing: Set<String>) ->
some View`

Specifies the external events that the view’s scene handles if the scene is
already open.

Instance Method

# handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)

Specifies the external events that the view’s scene handles if the scene is
already open.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func handlesExternalEvents(
        preferring: Set<String>,
        allowing: Set<String>
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`preferring`

    

A set of strings that SwiftUI compares against the incoming user activity or
URL to see if the view’s scene prefers to handle the external event.

`allowing`

    

A set of strings that SwiftUI compares against the incoming user activity or
URL to see if the view’s scene can handle the exernal event.

## Return Value

A view whose enclosing scene — if already open — handles incoming external
events.

## Discussion

Apply this modifier to a view to indicate whether an open scene that contains
the view handles specified user activities or URLs that your app receives.
Specify two sets of string identifiers to distinguish between the kinds of
events that the scene _prefers_ to handle and those that it _can_ handle. You
can dynamically update the identifiers in each set to reflect changing app
state.

When your app receives an event on a platform that supports multiple
simultaneous scenes, SwiftUI sends the event to the first open scene it finds
that prefers to handle the event. Otherwise, it sends the event to the first
open scene it finds that can handle the event. If it finds neither — including
when you don’t add this view modifier — SwiftUI creates a new scene for the
event.

Important

Don’t confuse this view modifier with the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)`
_scene_ modifier. You use the view modifier to indicate that an open scene
handles certain events, whereas you use the scene modifier to help SwiftUI
choose a new scene to open when no open scene handles the event.

On platforms that support only a single scene, SwiftUI ignores this modifier
and sends all external events to the one open scene.

### Matching an event

To find an open scene that handles a particular external event, SwiftUI
compares a property of the event against the strings that you specify in the
`preferring` and `allowing` sets. SwiftUI examines the following event
properties to perform the comparison:

  * For an `NSUserActivity`, like when your app handles Handoff, SwiftUI uses the activity’s `targetContentIdentifier` property, or if that’s `nil`, its `webpageURL` property rendered as an `absoluteString`.

  * For a `URL`, like when another process opens a URL that your app handles, SwiftUI uses the URL’s `absoluteString`.

For both parameter sets, an empty set of strings never matches. Similarly,
empty strings never match. Conversely, as a special case, the string that
contains only an asterisk (`*`) matches anything. The modifier performs string
comparisons that are case and diacritic insensitive.

If you specify multiple instances of this view modifier inside a single scene,
the scene uses the union of the respective `preferring` and `allowing` sets
from all the modifiers.

### Handling a user activity in an open scene

As an example, the following view — which participates in Handoff through the
`userActivity(_:isActive:_:)` and `onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)` methods
— updates its `preferring` set according to the current selection. The
enclosing scene prefers to handle an event for a contact that’s already
selected, but doesn’t volunteer itself as a preferred scene when no contact is
selected:

The above code also updates the `allowing` set to indicate that the scene can
handle any incoming event when there’s no current selection, but that it can’t
handle any event if the view already displays a contact. The `preferring` set
takes precedence in the special case where the incoming event exactly matches
the currently selected contact.

modified scene.

Instance Method

# backgroundTask(_:action:)

Runs the specified action when the system provides a background task.

iOS 16.0+  iPadOS 16.0+  macOS 13.0+  Mac Catalyst 16.0+  tvOS 16.0+  watchOS
9.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func backgroundTask<D, R>(
        _ task: BackgroundTask<D, R>,
        action: @escaping (D) async -> R
    ) -> some Scene where D : Sendable, R : Sendable
    

##  Parameters

`task`

    

The type of task with which to associate the provided action.

`action`

    

An async closure that the system runs for the specified task type.

## Discussion

When the system wakes your app or extension for one or more background tasks,
it will call any actions associated with matching tasks. When your async
actions return, the system put your app back into a suspended state. The
system considers the task completed when the action closure that you provide
returns. If the action closure has not returned when the task runs out of time
to complete, the system cancels the task. Use
`withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)` to observe whether the task
is low on runtime.

## Overview

Use a value of this type with the `backgroundTask(_:action:)` scene modifier

# State modifiers

Instance Method

# tag(_:)

Sets the unique tag value of this view.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func tag<V>(_ tag: V) -> some View where V : Hashable
    

##  Parameters

`tag`

    

A `Hashable` value to use as the view’s tag.

## Return Value

A view with the specified tag set.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to differentiate among certain selectable views, like the
possible values of a `Picker` or the tabs of a `TabView`. Tag values can be of
any type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol.

In the example below, the `ForEach` loop in the `Picker` view builder iterates
over the `Flavor` enumeration. It extracts the string value of each
enumeration element for use in constructing the row label, and uses the
enumeration value, cast as an optional, as input to the `tag(_:)` modifier.
The `Picker` requires the tags to have a type that exactly matches the
selection type, which in this case is an optional `Flavor`.

If you change `selectedFlavor` to be non-optional, you need to remove the
`Optional` cast from the tag input to match.

A `ForEach` automatically applies a default tag to each enumerated view using
the `id` parameter of the corresponding element. If the element’s `id`
parameter and the picker’s `selection` input have exactly the same type, you
can omit the explicit tag modifier. To see examples that don’t require an
explicit tag, see `Picker`.

# environment(_:)

Places an observable object in the view’s environment.

iOS 17.0+  iPadOS 17.0+  macOS 14.0+  Mac Catalyst 17.0+  tvOS 17.0+  watchOS
10.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func environment<T>(_ object: T?) -> some View where T : AnyObject, T : Observable
    

##  Parameters

`object`

    

The object to set for this object’s type in the environment, or `nil` to clear
an object of this type from the environment.

## Return Value

A view that has the specified object in its environment.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to place an object that you declare with the `Observable()`
macro into a view’s environment. For example, you can add an instance of a
custom observable `Profile` class to the environment of a `ContentView`:

You then read the object inside `ContentView` or one of its descendants using
the `Environment` property wrapper:

This modifier affects the given view, as well as that view’s descendant views.
It has no effect outside the view hierarchy on which you call it. The
environment of a given view hierarchy holds only one observable object of a
given type.

Note

This modifier takes an object that conforms to the `Observable` protocol. To
add environment objects that conform to the `ObservableObject` protocol, use
`environmentObject(_:)` instead.

### Modifying the environment of a view

`func environment<V>(WritableKeyPath<EnvironmentValues, V>, V) -> some View`

Sets the environment value of the specified key path to the given value.

function.

Instance Method

# environment(_:_:)

Sets the environment value of the specified key path to the given value.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func environment<V>(
        _ keyPath: WritableKeyPath<EnvironmentValues, V>,
        _ value: V
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`keyPath`

    

A key path that indicates the property of the `EnvironmentValues` structure to
update.

`value`

    

The new value to set for the item specified by `keyPath`.

## Return Value

A view that has the given value set in its environment.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to set one of the writable properties of the
`EnvironmentValues` structure, including custom values that you create. For
example, you can set the value associated with the `truncationMode` key:

You then read the value inside `MyView` or one of its descendants using the
`Environment` property wrapper:

SwiftUI provides dedicated view modifiers for setting most environment values,
like the `truncationMode(_:)` modifier which sets the `truncationMode` value:

Prefer the dedicated modifier when available, and offer your own when defining
custom environment values, as described in `EnvironmentKey`.

This modifier affects the given view, as well as that view’s descendant views.
It has no effect outside the view hierarchy on which you call it.

    func environmentObject<T>(_ object: T) -> some View where T : ObservableObject
    

##  Parameters

`object`

    

The object to store and make available to the view’s hierarchy.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to add an observable object to a view’s environment. The
object must conform to the `ObservableObject` protocol.

Adding an object to a view’s environment makes the object available to
subviews in the view’s hierarchy. To retrieve the object in a subview, use the
`EnvironmentObject` property wrapper.

Note

If the observable object conforms to the `Observable` protocol, use either
`environment(_:)` or the `environment(_:_:)` modifier to add the object to the
view’s environment.

    func defaultAppStorage(_ store: UserDefaults) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`store`

    

The user defaults to use as the default store for `AppStorage`.

## Discussion

If unspecified, the default store for a view hierarchy is
`UserDefaults.standard`, but can be set a to a custom one. For example,
sharing defaults between an app and an extension can override the default
store to one created with `UserDefaults.init(suiteName:_)`.

# SymbolRenderingMode

Type Property

# hierarchical

A mode that renders symbols as multiple layers, with different opacities
applied to the foreground style.

    static let hierarchical: SymbolRenderingMode

## Discussion

SwiftUI fills the first layer with the foreground style, and the others the
secondary, and tertiary variants of the foreground style. You can specify
these styles explicitly using the `foregroundStyle(_:_:)` and
`foregroundStyle(_:_:_:)` modifiers. If you only specify a primary foreground
style, SwiftUI automatically derives the others from that style. For example,
you can render a filled exclamation mark triangle with purple as the tint
color for the exclamation mark, and lower opacity purple for the triangle:

    static let palette: SymbolRenderingMode

## Discussion

In this mode SwiftUI maps each successively defined layer in the image to the
next of the primary, secondary, and tertiary variants of the foreground style.
You can specify these styles explicitly using the `foregroundStyle(_:_:)` and
`foregroundStyle(_:_:_:)` modifiers. If you only specify a primary foreground
style, SwiftUI automatically derives the others from that style. For example,
you can render a filled exclamation mark triangle with yellow as the tint
color for the exclamation mark, and fill the triangle with cyan:

You can also omit the symbol rendering mode, as specifying multiple foreground
styles implies switching to palette rendering mode:

# SwitchToggleStyle

Initializer

# init()

Creates a switch toggle style.

visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    init()

## Discussion

Don’t call this initializer directly. Instead, use the `switch` static
variable to create this style:

Instance Method

# makeBody(configuration:)

Creates a view that represents the body of a toggle switch.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func makeBody(configuration: SwitchToggleStyle.Configuration) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`configuration`

    

The properties of the toggle, including a label and a binding to the toggle’s
state.

## Return Value

A view that represents a switch.

## Discussion

SwiftUI implements this required method of the `ToggleStyle` protocol to
define the behavior and appearance of the `switch` toggle style. Don’t call
this method directly. Rather, the system calls this method for each `Toggle`
instance in a view hierarchy that’s styled as a switch.

# SurroundingsEffect

Type Property

# systemDark

An effect that dims passthrough video.

visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    static var systemDark: SurroundingsEffect { get }

## Discussion

Use this value with the `preferredSurroundingsEffect(_:)` view modifier when
you want to dim passthrough video while displaying a particular view. Doing so
helps to draw attention to your app’s content while still enabling people to
remain aware of their surroundings.

You don’t call this initializer directly. Instead, SwiftUI calls it for you
when you declare a property with the `@State` attribute and provide an initial
value:

SwiftUI initializes the state’s storage only once for each container instance
that you declare. In the above code, SwiftUI creates `isPlaying` only the
first time it initializes a particular instance of `MyView`. On the other
hand, each instance of `MyView` creates a distinct instance of the state. For
example, each of the views in the following `VStack` has its own `isPlaying`
value:

### Creating a state

`init(initialValue: Value)`

Creates a state property that stores an initial value.

`init()`

Creates a state property without an initial value.

Available when `Value` conforms to `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`.

Initializer

# init(initialValue:)

Creates a state property that stores an initial value.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    init(initialValue value: Value)

##  Parameters

`value`

    

An initial value to store in the state property.

## Discussion

This initializer has the same behavior as the `init(wrappedValue:)`
initializer. See that initializer for more information.

### Creating a state

`init(wrappedValue: Value)`

Creates a state property that stores an initial wrapped value.

`init()`

Creates a state property without an initial value.

Available when `Value` conforms to `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`.

Initializer

# init()

Creates a state property without an initial value.

    init()

Available when `Value` conforms to `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`.

## Discussion

This initializer behaves like the `init(wrappedValue:)` initializer with an
input of `nil`. See that initializer for more information.

### Creating a state

`init(wrappedValue: Value)`

Creates a state property that stores an initial wrapped value.

`init(initialValue: Value)`

Creates a state property that stores an initial value.

Instance Property

# wrappedValue

The underlying value referenced by the state variable.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var wrappedValue: Value { get nonmutating set }

## Discussion

This property provides primary access to the value’s data. However, you don’t
typically access `wrappedValue` explicitly. Instead, you gain access to the
wrapped value by referring to the property variable that you create with the
`@State` attribute.

In the following example, the button’s label depends on the value of
`isPlaying` and the button’s action toggles the value of `isPlaying`. Both of
these accesses implicitly access the state property’s wrapped value:

### Getting the value

`var projectedValue: Binding<Value>`

A binding to the state value.

Instance Property

# projectedValue

A binding to the state value.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    var projectedValue: Binding<Value> { get }

## Discussion

Use the projected value to get a `Binding` to the stored value. The binding
provides a two-way connection to the stored value. To access the
`projectedValue`, prefix the property variable with a dollar sign (`$`).

In the following example, `PlayerView` projects a binding of the state
property `isPlaying` to the `PlayButton` view using `$isPlaying`. That enables
the play button to both read and write the value:

### Getting the value

`var wrappedValue: Value`

The underlying value referenced by the state variable.

# ScenePhase

Case

# ScenePhase.active

The scene is in the foreground and interactive.

    case active

## Discussion

An active scene isn’t necessarily front-most. For example, a macOS window
might be active even if it doesn’t currently have focus. Nevertheless, all
scenes should operate normally in this phase.

An app or custom scene in this phase contains at least one active scene
instance.

## See Also

### Getting scene phases

`case inactive`

The scene is in the foreground but should pause its work.

`case background`

The scene isn’t currently visible in the UI.

    case inactive

## Discussion

A scene in this phase doesn’t receive events and should pause timers and free
any unnecessary resources. The scene might be completely hidden in the user
interface or otherwise unavailable to the user. In macOS, scenes only pass
through this phase temporarily on their way to the `ScenePhase.background`
phase.

An app or custom scene in this phase contains no scene instances in the
`ScenePhase.active` phase.

    case background

## Discussion

Do as little as possible in a scene that’s in the `background` phase. The
`background` phase can precede termination, so do any cleanup work immediately
upon entering this state. For example, close any open files and network
connections. However, a scene can also return to the `ScenePhase.active` phase
from the background.

Expect an app that enters the `background` phase to terminate.

# SectionedFetchRequest

Initializer

# init(sectionIdentifier:sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:)

Creates a sectioned fetch request based on a section identifier, a predicate,
and value type sort parameters.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    @MainActor
    init(
        sectionIdentifier: KeyPath<Result, SectionIdentifier>,
        sortDescriptors: [SortDescriptor<Result>],
        predicate: NSPredicate? = nil,
        animation: Animation? = nil
    )

Available when `SectionIdentifier` conforms to `Hashable` and `Result`
inherits `NSManagedObject`.

##  Parameters

`sectionIdentifier`

    

A key path that SwiftUI applies to the `Result` type to get an object’s
section identifier.

`sortDescriptors`

    

An array of sort descriptors that define the sort order of the fetched
results.

`predicate`

    

An `NSPredicate` instance that defines logical conditions used to filter the
fetched results.

`animation`

    

The animation to use for user interface changes that result from changes to
the fetched results.

## Discussion

The request gets the entity type from the `Result` instance by calling that
managed object’s `entity()` type method. If you need to specify the entity
type explicitly, use the
`init(entity:sectionIdentifier:sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:)`
initializer instead. If you need more control over the fetch request
configuration, use `init(fetchRequest:sectionIdentifier:animation:)`. For
reference type sort descriptors, use
`init(sectionIdentifier:sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:)`.

managed object’s `entity()` type method. If you need to specify the entity
type explicitly, use the
`init(entity:sectionIdentifier:sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:)`
initializer instead. If you need more control over the fetch request

        animation: Animation? = nil
    )

Available when `SectionIdentifier` conforms to `Hashable` and `Result`

##  Parameters

`fetchRequest`

    

An `NSFetchRequest` instance that describes the search criteria for retrieving
data from the persistent store.

`sectionIdentifier`

    

A key path that SwiftUI applies to the `Result` type to get an object’s
section identifier.

`animation`

    

The animation to use for user interface changes that result from changes to
the fetched results.

## Discussion

Use this initializer when you want to configure a fetch request with more than
a predicate and sort descriptors. For example, you can vend a request from a
`Quake` managed object that the Loading and Displaying a Large Data Feed
sample code project defines to store earthquake data. Limit the number of
results to `1000` by setting a `fetchLimit` for the request:

Use the request to define a `SectionedFetchedResults` property:

If you only need to configure the request’s section identifier, predicate, and
sort descriptors, use
`init(sectionIdentifier:sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:)` instead. If you
need to specify a `Transaction` rather than an optional `Animation`, use
`init(fetchRequest:sectionIdentifier:transaction:)`.

Structure

# SectionedFetchRequest.Configuration

The request’s configurable properties.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    struct Configuration

## Overview

You initialize a `SectionedFetchRequest` with a section identifier, an
optional predicate, and sort descriptors, either explicitly or with a
configured `NSFetchRequest`. Later, you can dynamically update the identifier,
predicate, and sort parameters using the request’s configuration structure.

You access or bind to a request’s configuration components through properties
on the associated `SectionedFetchResults` instance, just like you do for a
`FetchRequest` using `FetchRequest.Configuration`.

When configuring a sectioned fetch request, ensure that the combination of the
section identifier and the primary sort descriptor doesn’t create
discontiguous sections.

## Topics

### Setting the section identifier

`var sectionIdentifier: KeyPath<Result, SectionIdentifier>`

The request’s section identifier key path.

### Setting a predicate

`var nsPredicate: NSPredicate?`

The request’s predicate.

### Setting sort descriptors

`var sortDescriptors: [SortDescriptor<Result>]`

The request’s sort descriptors, accessed as value types.

Available when `SectionIdentifier` conforms to `Hashable` and `Result`
inherits `NSManagedObject`.

`var nsSortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor]`

The request’s sort descriptors, accessed as reference types.

## See Also

### Configuring a request dynamically

`var projectedValue: Binding<SectionedFetchRequest<SectionIdentifier,
Result>.Configuration>`

A binding to the request’s mutable configuration properties.

Instance Property

# projectedValue

A binding to the request’s mutable configuration properties.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    @MainActor
    var projectedValue: Binding<SectionedFetchRequest<SectionIdentifier, Result>.Configuration> { get }

## Discussion

This property behaves like the `projectedValue` of a `FetchRequest`. In
particular, SwiftUI returns the value associated with this property when you
use `SectionedFetchRequest` as a property wrapper on a `SectionedFetchResults`
instance and then access the results with a dollar sign (`$`) prefix. The
value that SwiftUI returns is a `Binding` to the request’s
`SectionedFetchRequest.Configuration` structure, which dynamically configures
the request.

`struct Configuration`

Instance Method

# update()

Updates the fetched results.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    @MainActor
    func update()

Available when `SectionIdentifier` conforms to `Hashable` and `Result`
conforms to `NSFetchRequestResult`.

## Discussion

SwiftUI calls this function before rendering a view’s `body` to ensure the
view has the most recent fetched results.

## See Also

### Getting the fetched results

`var wrappedValue: SectionedFetchResults<SectionIdentifier, Result>`

The fetched results of the fetch request.

Instance Property

# wrappedValue

The fetched results of the fetch request.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    @MainActor
    var wrappedValue: SectionedFetchResults<SectionIdentifier, Result> { get }

## Discussion

This property behaves like the `wrappedValue` of a `FetchRequest`. In
particular, SwiftUI returns the value associated with this property when you
use `SectionedFetchRequest` as a property wrapper and then access the wrapped
property by name. For example, consider the following `quakes` property
declaration that fetches a `Quake` type that the Loading and Displaying a
Large Data Feed sample code project defines:

You access the request’s `wrappedValue`, which contains a
`SectionedFetchResults` instance, by referring to the `quakes` property by
name. That value is a collection of sections, each of which contains a group
of managed objects:

If you need to separate the request and the result entities, you can declare
`quakes` in two steps by using the request’s `wrappedValue` to obtain the
results:

The `wrappedValue` property returns an empty array when there are no fetched
results; for example, because no entities satisfy the predicate, or because
the data store is empty.

## Topics

### Creating argument values

`static var boundingRect: Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the bounding rect of the shape or view
that the shader is attached to, as `float4(x, y, width, height)`. This value
is undefined for shaders that do not have a natural bounding rect (e.g. filter
effects drawn into `GraphicsContext`).

`static func color(Color) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing `color`. When passed to a MSL function
it will convert to a `half4` value, as a premultiplied color in the target
color space.

`static func colorArray([Color]) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value defined by the provided array of color values. When
passed to an MSL function it will convert to a `device const half4 *ptr, int
count` pair of parameters.

`static func data(Data) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value defined by the provided data value. When passed to
an MSL function it will convert to a `device const void *ptr, int
size_in_bytes` pair of parameters.

`static func float<T>(T) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the MSL value `float(x)`.

`static func float2(CGVector) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the MSL value `float2(vector.dx,
vector.dy)`.

`static func float2(CGPoint) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the MSL value `float2(point.x,
point.y)`.

`static func float2(CGSize) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the MSL value `float2(size.width,
size.height)`.

`static func float2<T>(T, T) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the MSL value `float2(x, y)`.

`static func float3<T>(T, T, T) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the MSL value `float3(x, y, z)`.

`static func float4<T>(T, T, T, T) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value representing the MSL value `float4(x, y, z, w)`.

`static func floatArray([Float]) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value defined by the provided array of floating point
numbers. When passed to an MSL function it will convert to a `device const
float *ptr, int count` pair of parameters.

`static func image(Image) -> Shader.Argument`

Returns an argument value defined by the provided image. When passed to an MSL
function it will convert to a `texture2d<half>` value. Currently only one
image parameter is supported per `Shader` instance.

Instance Property

# dithersColor

For shader functions that return color values, whether the returned color has
dither noise added to it, or is simply rounded to the output bit-depth. For
shaders generating smooth gradients, dithering is usually necessary to prevent
visible banding in the result.

9.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func searchSuggestions<S>(@ViewBuilder _ suggestions: () -> S) -> some View where S : View
    

##  Parameters

`suggestions`

    

A view builder that produces content that populates a list of suggestions.

## Discussion

You can suggest search terms during a search operation by providing a
collection of view to this modifier. The interface presents the suggestion
views as a list of choices when someone activates the search interface.
Associate a string with each suggestion view by adding the
`searchCompletion(_:)` modifier to the view. For example, you can suggest
fruit types by displaying their emoji, and provide the corresponding search
string as a search completion in each case:

When someone chooses a suggestion, SwiftUI replaces the text in the search
field with the search completion string. If you omit the search completion
modifier for a particular suggestion view, SwiftUI displays the suggestion,
but the suggestion view doesn’t react to taps or clicks.

Important

In tvOS, searchable modifiers only support suggestion views of type `Text`,
like in the above example. Other platforms can use any view for the
suggestions, including custom views.

You can update the suggestions that you provide as conditions change.

For example, you can specify an array of suggestions that you store in a
model:

If the model’s `suggestedSearches` begins as an empty array, the interface
doesn’t display any suggestions to start. You can then provide logic that
updates the array based on some condition. For example, you might update the
completions based on the current search text. Note that certain events or
actions, like when someone moves a macOS window, might dismiss the suggestion
view.

interface to your app.

9.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func searchSuggestions(
        _ visibility: Visibility,
        for placements: SearchSuggestionsPlacement.Set
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`visibility`

    

The visibility of the search suggestions for the specified locations.

`placements`

    

The set of locations in which to set the visibility of search suggestions.

## Discussion

SwiftUI presents search suggestions differently depending on several factors,
like the platform, the position of the search field, and the size class. Use
this modifier when you want to only display suggestions in certain ways under
certain conditions. For example, you might choose to display suggestions in a
menu when possible, but directly filter your data source otherwise.

## Discussion

Use this method to associate a search token with a view that is within a
search suggestion list context. The system uses this value when the view is
selected to replace the partial text being currently edited of the associated
search field.

Provide suggestions to people searching for content in your app.

`func searchSuggestions<S>(() -> S) -> some View`

Configures the search suggestions for this view.

`func searchSuggestions(Visibility, for: SearchSuggestionsPlacement.Set) ->
some View`

Configures how to display search suggestions within this view.

`func searchCompletion(String) -> some View`

Associates a fully formed string with the value of this view.

`func searchable<C, T>(text: Binding<String>, tokens: Binding<C>,
suggestedTokens: Binding<C>, placement: SearchFieldPlacement, prompt:
LocalizedStringKey, token: (C.Element) -> T) -> some View`

Marks this view as searchable with text, tokens, and suggestions.

`func searchable<C, T>(text: Binding<String>, tokens: Binding<C>,
suggestedTokens: Binding<C>, placement: SearchFieldPlacement, prompt: Text?,
token: (C.Element) -> T) -> some View`

Marks this view as searchable with text, tokens, and suggestions.

`func searchable<C, T, S>(text: Binding<String>, tokens: Binding<C>,
suggestedTokens: Binding<C>, placement: SearchFieldPlacement, prompt: S,
token: (C.Element) -> T) -> some View`

Marks this view as searchable with text, tokens, and suggestions.

`struct SearchSuggestionsPlacement`

The ways that SwiftUI displays search suggestions.

Instance Method

# searchCompletion(_:)

Associates a fully formed string with the value of this view.

iOS 15.0+  iPadOS 15.0+  macOS 12.0+  Mac Catalyst 15.0+  tvOS 15.0+  watchOS
8.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func searchCompletion(_ completion: String) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`text`

    

A string to use as the view’s completion.

## Discussion

Use this method to associate a fully formed string with a view that is within
a search suggestion list context. The system uses this value when the view is
selected to replace the partial text being currently edited of the associated
search field.

On tvOS, the string that you provide to the this modifier is used when
displaying the associated suggestion and when replacing the partial text of
the search field.

Instance Method

# searchScopes(_:scopes:)

Configures the search scopes for this view.

iOS 16.0+  iPadOS 16.0+  macOS 13.0+  Mac Catalyst 16.0+  tvOS 16.4+  visionOS
1.0+

    
    
    func searchScopes<V, S>(
        _ scope: Binding<V>,
        @ViewBuilder scopes: () -> S
    ) -> some View where V : Hashable, S : View
    

##  Parameters

`scope`

    

The active scope of the search field.

`scopes`

    

A view builder that represents the scoping options SwiftUI uses to populate a
`Picker`.

## Discussion

To enable people to narrow the scope of their searches, you can create a type
that represents the possible scopes, and then create a state variable to hold
the current selection. For example, you can scope the product search to just
fruits or just vegetables:

Provide a binding to the scope, as well as a view that represents each scope:

SwiftUI uses this binding and view to add a `Picker` with the search field. In
iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS, the picker appears below the search field when
search is active. To ensure that the picker operates correctly, match the type
of the scope binding with the type of each view’s tag. Then modify your search
to account for the current value of the `scope` state property.

interface to your app.

`Picker`.

## Discussion

To enable people to narrow the scope of their searches, you can create a type
that represents the possible scopes, and then create a state variable to hold
the current selection. For example, you can scope the product search to just
fruits or just vegetables:

Provide a binding to the scope, as well as a view that represents each scope:

SwiftUI uses this binding and view to add a `Picker` below the search field.
In iOS, macOS, and tvOS, the picker appears below the search field when search
is active. To ensure that the picker operates correctly, match the type of the
scope binding with the type of each view’s tag. Then condition your search on
the current value of the `scope` state property.

By default, the appearance of scopes varies by platform:

  * In iOS and iPadOS, search scopes appear when someone enters text into the search field and disappear when someone cancels the search.

  * In macOS, search scopes appear when SwiftUI presents search and disappear when someone cancels the search.

However, you can use the `activation` parameter with a value of `onTextEntry`
or `onSearchPresentation` to configure this behavior:

For more information about using searchable modifiers, see Adding a search
interface to your app.

    static var viewAligned: ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior { get }

Available when `Self` is `ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior`.

## Discussion

You use this behavior when a scroll view should always align its scroll
targets to a rectangle that’s aligned to the geometry of a view. In the
following example, the scroll view always picks an item view to settle on.

You configure which views should be used for settling using the
`View/scrollTargetLayout()` modifier. Apply this modifier to a layout
container like `LazyVStack` or `HStack` and each individual view in that
layout will be considered for alignment.

You can customize whether the view aligned behavior limits the number of views
that can be scrolled at a time by using the
`ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.LimitBehavior` type. Provide a value of
`ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.LimitBehavior/always` to always have the
behavior only allow a few views to be scrolled at a time.

By default, the view aligned behavior limits the number of views it scrolls
when in a compact horizontal size class when scrollable in the horizontal
axis, when in a compact vertical size class when scrollable in the vertical
axis, and otherwise doesn’t impose any limit on the number of views that can
be scrolled.

## Discussion

The system calls this method in two main cases:

  * When a scroll gesture ends, it calculates where it would naturally scroll to using its deceleration rate. The system provides this calculated value as the target of this method.

  * When a scrollable view’s size changes, it calculates where it should be scrolled given the new size and provides this calculates value as the target of this method.

You can implement this method to override the calculated target which will
have the scrollable view scroll to a different position than it would
otherwise.

A format style of type `F` to use when converting between the string the user
edits and the underlying value of type `F.FormatInput`. If `format` can’t
perform the conversion, the stepper leaves `value` unchanged. If the user
stops editing the text in an invalid state, the stepper updates the text to
the last known valid value.

`label`

    

A view describing the purpose of this stepper.

`onEditingChanged`

    

A closure that’s called when editing begins and ends. For example, on iOS, the

##  Parameters

`title`

    

A string describing the purpose of the stepper.

`value`

    

The `Binding` to a value that you provide.

`step`

    

The amount to increment or decrement `value` each time the user clicks or taps
the stepper’s increment or decrement button, respectively. Defaults to `1`.

`format`

    

A format style of type `F` to use when converting between the string the user
edits and the underlying value of type `F.FormatInput`. If `format` can’t
perform the conversion, the stepper leaves `value` unchanged. If the user
stops editing the text in an invalid state, the stepper updates the text to
the last known valid value.

`onEditingChanged`

Initializer

# init(label:onIncrement:onDecrement:onEditingChanged:)

Creates a stepper instance that performs the closures you provide when the
user increments or decrements the stepper.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    init(
        @ViewBuilder label: () -> Label,
        onIncrement: (() -> Void)?,
        onDecrement: (() -> Void)?,
        onEditingChanged: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }
    )

##  Parameters

`label`

    

A view describing the purpose of this stepper.

`onIncrement`

    

The closure to execute when the user clicks or taps the control’s plus button.

`onDecrement`

    

The closure to execute when the user clicks or taps the control’s minus
button.

`onEditingChanged`

    

A closure called when editing begins and ends. For example, on iOS, the user
may touch and hold the increment or decrement buttons on a `Stepper` which
causes the execution of the `onEditingChanged` closure at the start and end of
the gesture.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a control with a custom title that executes
closures you provide when the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or
decrement buttons.

The example below uses an array that holds a number of `Color` values, a local
state variable, `value`, to set the control’s background color, and title
label. When the user clicks or taps on the stepper’s increment or decrement
buttons SwiftUI executes the relevant closure that updates `value`, wrapping
the `value` to prevent overflow. SwiftUI then re-renders the view, updating
the text and background color to match the current index:

Available when `Label` is `Text`.

Initializer

# init(_:onIncrement:onDecrement:onEditingChanged:)

Creates a stepper that uses a title key and executes the closures you provide
when the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment and decrement buttons.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  watchOS 9.0+

    init(
        _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
        onIncrement: (() -> Void)?,
        onDecrement: (() -> Void)?,
        onEditingChanged: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }
    )

Available when `Label` is `Text`.

##  Parameters

`titleKey`

    

The key for the stepper’s localized title describing the purpose of the
stepper.

`onIncrement`

    

The closure to execute when the user clicks or taps the control’s plus button.

`onDecrement`

    

The closure to execute when the user clicks or taps the control’s minus
button.

`onEditingChanged`

    

A closure that’s called when editing begins and ends. For example, on iOS, the
user may touch and hold the increment or decrement buttons on a `Stepper`
which causes the execution of the `onEditingChanged` closure at the start and
end of the gesture.

## Discussion

Use this initializer to create a stepper with a custom title that executes
closures you provide when either of the stepper’s increment or decrement
buttons are pressed. This version of `Stepper` doesn’t take a binding to a
value, nor does it allow you to specify a range of acceptable values, or a
step value – it simply calls the closures you provide when the control’s
buttons are pressed.

The example below uses an array that holds a number of `Color` values, a local
state variable, `value`, to set the control’s background color, and title
label. When the user clicks or taps on the stepper’s increment or decrement
buttons SwiftUI executes the relevant closure that updates `value`, wrapping
the `value` to prevent overflow. SwiftUI then re-renders the view, updating
the text and background color to match the current index:

You can also use this modifier to set the style for controls that acquire a
button style through composition, like the `Menu` and `Toggle` views in the
following example:

The `menuStyle(_:)` modifier causes the Terms and Conditions menu to render as
a button. Similarly, the `toggleStyle(_:)` modifier causes the two toggles to
render as buttons. The button style modifier then causes not only the explicit
Sign In `Button`, but also the menu and toggles with button styling, to render
with the bordered button style.

    func toggleStyle<S>(_ style: S) -> some View where S : ToggleStyle
    

##  Parameters

`style`

    

The toggle style to set. Use one of the built-in values, like `switch` or
`button`, or a custom style that you define by creating a type that conforms
to the `ToggleStyle` protocol.

## Return Value

A view that uses the specified toggle style for itself and its child views.

## Discussion

Use this modifier on a `Toggle` instance to set a style that defines the
control’s appearance and behavior. For example, you can choose the `switch`
style:

Built-in styles typically have a similar appearance across platforms, tailored
to the platform’s overall style:

Platform| Appearance  
---|---  
iOS, iPadOS|  
macOS|  
  
### Styling toggles in a hierarchy

You can set a style for all toggle instances within a view hierarchy by
applying the style modifier to a container view. For example, you can apply
the `button` style to an `HStack`:

The example above has the following appearance when `isFlagged` is `true` and
`isMuted` is `false`:

Platform| Appearance  
---|---  
iOS, iPadOS|  
macOS|  
  
### Automatic styling

If you don’t set a style, SwiftUI assumes a value of `automatic`, which
corresponds to a context-specific default. Specify the automatic style
explicitly to override a container’s style and revert to the default:

The style that SwiftUI uses as the default depends on both the platform and
the context. In macOS, the default in most contexts is a `checkbox`, while in
iOS, the default toggle style is a `switch`:

Platform| Appearance  
---|---  
iOS, iPadOS|  
macOS|  
  
Note

Like toggle style does for toggles, the `labelStyle(_:)` modifier sets the
style for `Label` instances in the hierarchy. The example above demostrates
the compact `iconOnly` style, which is useful for button toggles in space-
constrained contexts. Always include a descriptive title for better
accessibility.

For more information about how SwiftUI chooses a default toggle style, see the
`automatic` style.

Instance Method

# onChange(of:initial:_:)

Adds an action to perform when the given value changes.

iOS 17.0+  iPadOS 17.0+  macOS 14.0+  Mac Catalyst 17.0+  tvOS 17.0+  watchOS
10.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func onChange<V>(
        of value: V,
        initial: Bool = false,
        _ action: @escaping () -> Void
    ) -> some Scene where V : Equatable
    

##  Parameters

`value`

    

The value to check when determining whether to run the closure. The value must
conform to the `Equatable` protocol.

`initial`

    

Whether the action should be run when this scene initially appears.

`action`

    

A closure to run when the value changes.

## Return Value

A scene that triggers an action in response to a change.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to trigger a side effect when a value changes, like the
value associated with an `Environment` key or a `Binding`. For example, you
can clear a cache when you notice that a scene moves to the background:

The system may call the action closure on the main actor, so avoid long-
running tasks in the closure. If you need to perform such tasks, detach an
asynchronous background task:

When the value changes, the new version of the closure will be called, so any
captured values will have their values from the time that the observed value
has its new value.

The value to check when determining whether to run the closure. The value must
conform to the `Equatable` protocol.

`initial`

    

Whether the action should be run when this scene initially appears.

A closure to run when the value changes.

`oldValue`

    

The old value that failed the comparison check (or the initial value when
requested).

`newValue`

    

The new value that failed the comparison check.

## Return Value

A scene that triggers an action in response to a change.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to trigger a side effect when a value changes, like the

# handlesExternalEvents(matching:)

Specifies the external events for which SwiftUI opens a new instance of the
modified scene.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func handlesExternalEvents(matching conditions: Set<String>) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`conditions`

    

A set of strings that SwiftUI compares against the incoming user activity or
URL to see if SwiftUI can open a new scene instance to handle the external
event.

## Return Value

A scene type that limits the kinds of external events for which SwiftUI opens
a new instance.

## Discussion

When your app receives an external event like a user activity or a URL,
SwiftUI routes the event to a scene for processing. SwiftUI selects the scene
that receives the event according to the following rules, which it evaluates
in order until it finds a destination scene:

  * On platforms that support only a single scene per app, send the event to the one open scene.

  * Find an open scene that indicates it prefers to or can handle the event, if any, and send the event to that scene. You use the `handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)` view modifier on a view inside the scene to register this preference.

  * Find a scene declaration with a `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` scene modifier containing `conditions` that match the external event. Create a new instance of the first scene that matches and route the event there.

  * Find the first scene declaration that doesn’t have the scene modifier. Create a new instance of this scene and route the event there.

Make sure that at least one of these rules succeeds in your app for all events
that your app claims to handle. Also, make sure that the scene that receives
an event actually handles it. For example, be sure that a scene that receives
user activities handles them with an appropriate
`onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)` view modifier.

Don’t confuse the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` scene modifier with the
`handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)` _view_ modifier. You use the
scene modifier to help SwiftUI choose a new scene to open when no open scene
handles an external event, whereas you use the view modifier to indicate that
an open scene can or prefers to handle certain events.

### Matching an event

To find a scene type that handles a particular external event, SwiftUI
compares a property of the event against the strings that you specify in the
`conditions` set. SwiftUI examines the following event properties to perform
the comparison:

  * For an `NSUserActivity`, like when your app handles Handoff, SwiftUI uses the activity’s `targetContentIdentifier` property, or if that’s `nil`, its `webpageURL` property rendered as an `absoluteString`.

  * For a `URL`, like when another process opens a URL that your app handles, SwiftUI uses the URL’s `absoluteString`.

An empty set of strings never matches. Similarly, empty strings never match.
Conversely, as a special case, the string that contains only an asterisk (`*`)
matches anything. The modifier performs string comparisons that are case and
diacritic insensitive.

Important

`DocumentGroup` scenes ignore this modifier. Instead, document scenes decide
whether to open a new scene to handle an external event by comparing the
incoming URL or user activity’s `webpageURL` against the document group’s
supported types.

### Choosing a window to open

The following example shows an app with a photo browser scene that displays a
collection of photos, and a photo detail scene that enables closer examination
of a particular photo:

The app uses the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` modifier on the second
scene to ensure that an external event with an identifier that contains the
string `photoIdentifier=` creates a new scene of the second type. Other
events, if not handled by an open scene, cause the creation of a new browser
window instead.

### Handling external events

`func handlesExternalEvents(preferring: Set<String>, allowing: Set<String>) ->
some View`

Specifies the external events that the view’s scene handles if the scene is
already open.

Instance Method

# backgroundTask(_:action:)

Runs the specified action when the system provides a background task.

iOS 16.0+  iPadOS 16.0+  macOS 13.0+  Mac Catalyst 16.0+  tvOS 16.0+  watchOS
9.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func backgroundTask<D, R>(
        _ task: BackgroundTask<D, R>,
        action: @escaping (D) async -> R
    ) -> some Scene where D : Sendable, R : Sendable
    

##  Parameters

`task`

    

The type of task with which to associate the provided action.

`action`

    

An async closure that the system runs for the specified task type.

## Discussion

When the system wakes your app or extension for one or more background tasks,
it will call any actions associated with matching tasks. When your async
actions return, the system put your app back into a suspended state. The
system considers the task completed when the action closure that you provide
returns. If the action closure has not returned when the task runs out of time
to complete, the system cancels the task. Use
`withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)` to observe whether the task
is low on runtime.

## See Also

### Handling background tasks

`struct BackgroundTask`

The kinds of background tasks that your app or extension can handle.

`struct SnapshotData`

The associated data of a snapshot background task.

`struct SnapshotResponse`

Your appplication’s response to a snapshot background task.

Instance Method

# defaultAppStorage(_:)

The default store used by `AppStorage` contained within the scene and its view
content.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func defaultAppStorage(_ store: UserDefaults) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`store`

    

The user defaults to use as the default store for `AppStorage`.

## Discussion

If unspecified, the default store for a view hierarchy is
`UserDefaults.standard`, but can be set a to a custom one. For example,
sharing defaults between an app and an extension can override the default
store to one created with `UserDefaults.init(suiteName:_)`.

Instance Method

# commands(content:)

Adds commands to the scene.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func commands<Content>(@CommandsBuilder content: () -> Content) -> some Scene where Content : Commands
    

## Discussion

Commands are realized in different ways on different platforms. On macOS, the
main menu uses the available command menus and groups to organize its main
menu items. Each menu is represented as a top-level menu bar menu, and each
command group has a corresponding set of menu items in one of the top-level
menus, delimited by separator menu items.

On iPadOS, commands with keyboard shortcuts are exposed in the shortcut
discoverability HUD that users see when they hold down the Command (⌘) key.

### Defining commands

`func commandsRemoved() -> some Scene`

Removes all commands defined by the modified scene.

`func commandsReplaced<Content>(content: () -> Content) -> some Scene`

Replaces all commands defined by the modified scene with the commands from the
builder.

`protocol Commands`

Conforming types represent a group of related commands that can be exposed to
the user via the main menu on macOS and key commands on iOS.

`struct CommandMenu`

Command menus are stand-alone, top-level containers for controls that perform
related, app-specific commands.

`struct CommandGroup`

Groups of controls that you can add to existing command menus.

`struct CommandsBuilder`

Constructs command sets from multi-expression closures. Like `ViewBuilder`, it
supports up to ten expressions in the closure body.

`struct CommandGroupPlacement`

The standard locations that you can place new command groups relative to.

Instance Method

# commandsRemoved()

Removes all commands defined by the modified scene.

iOS 16.0+  iPadOS 16.0+  macOS 13.0+  Mac Catalyst 16.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func commandsRemoved() -> some Scene
    

## Return Value

A scene that excludes any commands defined by its children.

## Discussion

`WindowGroup`, `Window`, and other scene types all have an associated set of
commands that they include by default. Apply this modifier to a scene to
exclude those commands.

For example, the following code adds a scene for presenting the details of an
individual data model in a separate window. To ensure that the window can only
appear programmatically, we remove the scene’s commands, including File > New
Note Window.

    func commandsReplaced<Content>(@CommandsBuilder content: () -> Content) -> some Scene where Content : Commands
    

##  Parameters

`content`

    

A `Commands` builder whose output will be used to replace the commands
normally provided by the modified scene.

## Return Value

A scene that replaces any commands defined by its children with alternative
content.

## Discussion

`WindowGroup`, `Window`, and other scene types all have an associated set of
commands that they include by default. Apply this modifier to a scene to
replace those commands with the output from the given builder.

For example, the following code adds a scene for showing the contents of the
pasteboard in a dedicated window. We replace the scene’s default Window >
Clipboard menu command with a custom Edit > Show Clipboard command that we
place next to the other pasteboard commands.

Instance Method

# keyboardShortcut(_:)

Defines a keyboard shortcut for opening new scene windows.

macOS 13.0+

    
    
    func keyboardShortcut(_ shortcut: KeyboardShortcut?) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`shortcut`

    

The keyboard shortcut for presenting the scene, or `nil`.

## Return Value

A scene that can be presented with a keyboard shortcut.

## Discussion

A scene’s keyboard shortcut is bound to the command it adds for creating new
windows (in the case of `WindowGroup` and `DocumentGroup`) or bringing a
singleton window forward (in the case of `Window` and, on macOS, `Settings`).
Pressing the keyboard shortcut is equivalent to selecting the menu command.

In cases where a command already has a keyboard shortcut, the scene’s keyboard
shortcut is used instead. For example, `WindowGroup` normally creates a File >
New Window menu command whose keyboard shortcut is `⌘N`. The following code
changes it to something based on dynamic state:

If `shortcut` is `nil`, the scene’s presentation command will not be
associated with a keyboard shortcut, even if SwiftUI normally assigns one
automatically.

Defines a keyboard shortcut for opening new scene windows.

Instance Method

# keyboardShortcut(_:modifiers:localization:)

Defines a keyboard shortcut for opening new scene windows.

macOS 13.0+

    
    
    func keyboardShortcut(
        _ key: KeyEquivalent,
        modifiers: EventModifiers = .command,
        localization: KeyboardShortcut.Localization = .automatic
    ) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`key`

    

The key equivalent the user presses to present the scene.

`modifiers`

    

The modifier keys required to perform the shortcut.

`localization`

    

The localization style to apply to the shortcut.

## Return Value

A scene that can be presented with a keyboard shortcut.

## Discussion

A scene’s keyboard shortcut is bound to the command it adds for creating new
windows (in the case of `WindowGroup` and `DocumentGroup`) or bringing a
singleton window forward (in the case of `Window` and, on macOS, `Settings`).
Pressing the keyboard shortcut is equivalent to selecting the menu command.

In cases where a command already has a keyboard shortcut, the scene’s keyboard
shortcut is used instead. For example, `WindowGroup` normally creates a File >
New Window menu command whose keyboard shortcut is `⌘N`. The following code
changes it to `⌥⌘N`:

### Localization

Provide a `localization` value to specify how this shortcut should be
localized.

Given that `key` is always defined in relation to the US-English keyboard
layout, it might be hard to reach on different international layouts. For
example the shortcut `⌘[` works well for the US layout but is hard to reach
for German users, where `[` is available by pressing `⌥5`, making users type
`⌥⌘5`. The automatic keyboard shortcut remapping re-assigns the shortcut to an
appropriate replacement, `⌘Ö` in this case.

Providing the option `custom` disables the automatic localization for this
shortcut to tell the system that internationalization is taken care of in a
different way.

Instance Method

# defaultPosition(_:)

Sets a default position for a window.

macOS 13.0+

    
    
    func defaultPosition(_ position: UnitPoint) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`position`

    

A `UnitPoint` that specifies where to place a newly opened window relative to
the screen bounds.

## Return Value

A scene that uses a default position for new windows.

## Discussion

The first time your app opens a window from a particular scene declaration,
the system places the window at the center of the screen by default. For scene
types that support multiple simultaneous windows, the system offsets each
additional window by a small amount to avoid completely obscuring existing
windows.

You can override the default placement of the first window by applying a scene
modifier that indicates where to place the window relative to the screen
bounds. For example, you can request that the system place a new window in the
bottom trailing corner of the screen:

The system aligns the point in the window that corresponds to the specified
`UnitPoint` with the point in the screen that corresponds to the same unit
point.

You typically use one of the predefined unit points — like `bottomTrailing` in
the above example — but you can also use a custom unit point. For example, the
following modifier aligns the point that’s one quarter of the way from the
leading edge of the window with the point that’s one quarter of the way from
the leading edge of the screen, while centering the window in the y-dimension:

The modifier affects any scene type that creates windows in macOS, namely:

  * `WindowGroup`

  * `Window`

  * `DocumentGroup`

  * `Settings`

The value that you provide acts only as an initial default. During state
restoration, the system restores the window to the position that it last
occupied.

iOS 17.0+  iPadOS 17.0+  macOS 13.0+  Mac Catalyst 17.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func defaultSize(_ size: CGSize) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`size`

    

The default size for new windows created from a scene.

## Return Value

A scene that uses a default size for new windows.

## Discussion

Use this scene modifier to indicate a default initial size for a new window
that the system creates from a `Scene` declaration. For example, you can
request that new windows that a `WindowGroup` generates occupy 600 points in
the x-dimension and 400 points in the y-dimension:

The size that you specify acts only as a default for when the window first
appears. People can later resize the window using interface controls that the
system provides. Also, during state restoration, the system restores windows
to their most recent size rather than the default size.

If you specify a default size that’s outside the range of the window’s
inherent resizability in one or both dimensions, the system clamps the
affected dimension to keep it in range. You can configure the resizability of
a scene using the `windowResizability(_:)` modifier.

The default size modifier affects any scene type that creates windows in
macOS, namely:

  * `WindowGroup`

  * `Window`

  * `DocumentGroup`

  * `Settings`

If you want to specify the input directly in terms of width and height, use
`defaultSize(width:height:)` instead.

    func windowResizability(_ resizability: WindowResizability) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`resizability`

    

The resizability to use for windows created by this scene.

## Return Value

A scene that uses the specified resizability strategy.

## Discussion

Use this scene modifier to apply a value of type `WindowResizability` to a
`Scene` that you define in your `App` declaration. The value that you specify
indicates the strategy the system uses to place minimum and maximum size
restrictions on windows that it creates from that scene.

For example, you can create a window group that people can resize to between
100 and 400 points in both dimensions by applying both a frame with those
constraints to the scene’s content, and the `contentSize` resizability to the
scene:

The default value for all scenes if you don’t apply the modifier is
`automatic`. With that strategy, `Settings` windows use the `contentSize`
strategy, while all others use `contentMinSize`.

        selection: Binding<any ImmersionStyle>,
        in styles: any ImmersionStyle...
    ) -> some Scene
    

##  Parameters

`selection`

    

A `Binding` to the style that the space uses. You can change this value to
change the scene’s style even after you present the immersive space. Even
though you provide a binding, the value changes only if you change it.

`styles`

    

The list of styles that the `selection` input can have. Include any styles
that you plan to use during the lifetime of the scene.

## Return Value

A scene that uses one of the specified `styles`.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to configure the appearance and behavior of an
`ImmersiveSpace`. Specify a style that conforms to the `ImmersionStyle`
protocol, like `mixed` or `full`. For example, the following app defines a
solar system scene that uses full immersion:

Instance Method

# upperLimbVisibility(_:)

Sets the preferred visibility of the user’s upper limbs, while an
`ImmersiveSpace` scene is presented.

visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func upperLimbVisibility(_ preferredVisibility: Visibility) -> some Scene
    

## Discussion

The system can show the user’s upper limbs during fully immersive experiences,
but you can also hide them, for example, in order to display virtual hands
instead.

Note that this modifier only sets a preference and ultimately the system will
decide if it will honor it or not. The system may by unable to honor the
preference if the immersive space is currently not visible.

associated with this container. All implicit model context operations in this
scene, such as `Query` properties, will use the environment’s context.

By default, the container stores its model data persistently on disk. To only
store data in memory for the lifetime of the app’s process, pass `true` to the
`inMemory:` parameter.

The container will only be created once. New values that are passed to the

Instance Method

# environment(_:)

Places an observable object in the scene’s environment.

10.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    func environment<T>(_ object: T?) -> some Scene where T : AnyObject, T : Observable
    

##  Parameters

`object`

    

The object to set for this object’s type in the environment, or `nil` to clear
an object of this type from the environment.

## Return Value

A scene that has the specified object in its environment.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to place an object that you declare with the `Observable()`
macro into a scene’s environment. For example, you can add an instance of a
custom observable `Profile` class to the environment of a `WindowGroup` scene:

You then read the object inside `ContentView` or one of its descendants using
the `Environment` property wrapper:

This modifier affects the given scene, as well as the scene’s descendant
views. It has no effect outside the view hierarchy on which you call it. The
environment of a given view hierarchy holds only one observable object of a
given type.

Note

This modifier takes an object that conforms to the `Observable` protocol. To
add environment objects that conform to the `ObservableObject` protocol, use
`environmentObject(_:)` instead.

##  Parameters

`keyPath`

    

A key path that indicates the property of the `EnvironmentValues` structure to
update.

`value`

    

The new value to set for the item specified by `keyPath`.

## Return Value

A view that has the given value set in its environment.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to set one of the writable properties of the
`EnvironmentValues` structure, including custom values that you create. For
example, you can create a custom environment key `styleOverrides` to set a
value that represents style settings that for the entire app:

You then read the value inside `ContentView` or one of its descendants using
the `Environment` property wrapper:

This modifier affects the given scene, as well as that scene’s descendant
views. It has no effect outside the view hierarchy on which you call it.

# onChange(of:perform:)

Adds an action to perform when the given value changes.

    func onChange<V>(
        of value: V,
        perform action: @escaping (V) -> Void
    ) -> some Scene where V : Equatable
    

Deprecated

Use `onChange(of:initial:_:)` or `onChange(of:initial:_:)` instead. The
trailing closure in each case takes either zero or two input parameters,
compared to this method which takes one.

Be aware that the replacements have slightly different behvavior. This
modifier’s closure captures values that represent the state before the change.
The new modifiers capture values that correspond to the new state. The new
behavior makes it easier to perform updates that rely on values other than the
one that caused the modifier’s closure to run.

##  Parameters

`value`

    

The value to check when determining whether to run the closure. The value must
conform to the `Equatable` protocol.

`action`

    

A closure to run when the value changes. The closure provides a single
`newValue` parameter that indicates the changed value.

## Return Value

A scene that triggers an action in response to a change.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to trigger a side effect when a value changes, like the
value associated with an `Environment` value or a `Binding`. For example, you
can clear a cache when you notice that a scene moves to the background:

The system may call the action closure on the main actor, so avoid long-
running tasks in the closure. If you need to perform such tasks, detach an
asynchronous background task:

The system passes the new value into the closure. If you need the old value,
capture it in the closure.

# Scroll views

Structure

# ScrollView

A scrollable view.

iOS 13.0+  iPadOS 13.0+  macOS 10.15+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+  tvOS 13.0+  watchOS
6.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    struct ScrollView<Content> where Content : View

## Overview

The scroll view displays its content within the scrollable content region. As
the user performs platform-appropriate scroll gestures, the scroll view
adjusts what portion of the underlying content is visible. `ScrollView` can
scroll horizontally, vertically, or both, but does not provide zooming
functionality.

In the following example, a `ScrollView` allows the user to scroll through a
`VStack` containing 100 `Text` views. The image after the listing shows the
scroll view’s temporarily visible scrollbar at the right; you can disable it
with the `showsIndicators` parameter of the `ScrollView` initializer.

### Controlling Scroll Position

You can influence where a scroll view is initially scrolled by using the
`defaultScrollAnchor(_:)` view modifier.

Provide a value of `UnitPoint/center`` to have the scroll view start in the
center of its content when a scroll view is scrollable in both axes.

Or provide an alignment of `UnitPoint/bottom`` to have the scroll view start
at the bottom of its content when a scroll view is scrollable in its vertical
axes.

After the scroll view initially renders, the user may scroll the content of
the scroll view.

To perform programmatic scrolling, wrap one or more scroll views with a
`ScrollViewReader`.

## Topics

### Creating a scroll view

`init(Axis.Set, showsIndicators: Bool, content: () -> Content)`

Creates a new instance that’s scrollable in the direction of the given axis
and can show indicators while scrolling.

`init(Axis.Set, content: () -> Content)`

Creates a new instance that’s scrollable in the direction of the given axis
and can show indicators while scrolling.

Available when `Content` conforms to `View`.

### Configuring a scroll view

`var content: Content`

The scroll view’s content.

`var axes: Axis.Set`

The scrollable axes of the scroll view.

`var showsIndicators: Bool`

A value that indicates whether the scroll view displays the scrollable
component of the content offset, in a way that’s suitable for the platform.

    @frozen
    struct ScrollViewReader<Content> where Content : View

## Overview

The scroll view reader’s content view builder receives a `ScrollViewProxy`
instance; you use the proxy’s `scrollTo(_:anchor:)` to perform scrolling.

The following example creates a `ScrollView` containing 100 views that
together display a color gradient. It also contains two buttons, one each at
the top and bottom. The top button tells the `ScrollViewProxy` to scroll to
the bottom button, and vice versa.

Important

You may not use the `ScrollViewProxy` during execution of the `content` view
builder; doing so results in a runtime error. Instead, only actions created
within `content` can call the proxy, such as gesture handlers or a view’s
`onChange(of:perform:)` method.

    struct ScrollViewProxy

## Overview

You don’t create instances of `ScrollViewProxy` directly. Instead, your
`ScrollViewReader` receives an instance of `ScrollViewProxy` in its `content`
view builder. You use actions within this view builder, such as button and
gesture handlers or the `onChange(of:perform:)` method, to call the proxy’s
`scrollTo(_:anchor:)` method.

`func scrollTo<ID>(ID, anchor: UnitPoint?)`

# scrollPosition(id:anchor:)

Associates a binding to be updated when a scroll view within this view
scrolls.

    func scrollPosition(
        id: Binding<(some Hashable)?>,
        anchor: UnitPoint? = nil
    ) -> some View
    

## Discussion

Use this modifier along with the `View/scrollTargetLayout()` modifier to know
the identity of the view that is actively scrolled. As the scroll view
scrolls, the binding will be updated with the identity of the leading-most /
top-most view.

Use the `View/scrollTargetLayout()` modifier to configure which the layout
that contains your scroll targets. In the following example, the top-most
ItemView will update with the scrolledID binding as the scroll view scrolls.

You can write to the binding to scroll to the view with the provided identity.

SwiftUI will attempt to keep the view with the identity specified in the
provided binding when events occur that might cause it to be scrolled out of
view by the system. Some examples of these include:

  * The data backing the content of a scroll view is re-ordered.

  * The size of the scroll view changes, like when a window is resized on macOS or during a rotation on iOS.

  * The scroll view initially lays out it content defaulting to the top most view, but the binding has a different view’s identity.

You can provide an anchor to this modifier to both:

  * Influence which view the system chooses as the view whose identity value will update the providing binding as the scroll view scrolls.

  * Control the alignment of the view when scrolling to a view when writing a new binding value.

For example, providing a value of `bottom` will prefer to have the bottom-most
view chosen and prefer to scroll to views aligned to the bottom.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to specify an anchor to control both which part of the
scroll view’s content should be visible initially and how the scroll view
handles content size changes.

Provide a value of `UnitPoint/center`` to have the scroll view start in the
center of its content when a scroll view is scrollable in both axes.

Provide a value of `UnitPoint/bottom` to have the scroll view start at the
bottom of its content when scrollable in the vertical axis.

The user may scroll away from the initial defined scroll position. When the
content size of the scroll view changes, it may consult the anchor to know how
to reposition the content.

    func scrollTargetBehavior(_ behavior: some ScrollTargetBehavior) -> some View
    

## Discussion

A scrollable view calculates where scroll gestures should end using its
deceleration rate and the state of its scroll gesture by default. A scroll
behavior allows for customizing this logic. You can provide your own
`ScrollTargetBehavior` or use one of the built in behaviors provided by
SwiftUI.

### Paging Behavior

SwiftUI offers a `PagingScrollTargetBehavior` behavior which uses the geometry
of the scroll view to decide where to allow scrolls to end.

In the following example, every view in the lazy stack is flexible in both
directions and the scroll view will settle to container aligned boundaries.

### View Aligned Behavior

SwiftUI offers a `ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior` scroll behavior that will
always settle on the geometry of individual views.

You configure which views should be used for settling using the
`scrollTargetLayout(isEnabled:)` modifier. Apply this modifier to a layout
container like `LazyVStack` or `HStack` and each individual view in that
layout will be considered for alignment.

    func scrollTargetLayout(isEnabled: Bool = true) -> some View
    

## Discussion

This modifier works together with the `ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior` to
ensure that scroll views align to view based content.

Apply this modifier to layout containers like `LazyHStack` or `VStack` within
a `ScrollView` that contain the main repeating content of your `ScrollView`.

Scroll target layouts act as a convenience for applying a
`View/scrollTarget(isEnabled:)` modifier to each views in the layout.

A scroll target layout will ensure that any target layout nested within the
primary one will not also become a scroll target layout.

# ScrollTargetBehavior

A type that defines the scroll behavior of a scrollable view.

    protocol ScrollTargetBehavior

## Overview

A scrollable view calculates where scroll gestures should end using its
deceleration rate and the state of its scroll gesture by default. A scroll
behavior allows for customizing this logic.

You define a scroll behavior using the `updateTarget(_:context:)` method.

Using this method, you can control where someone can scroll in a scrollable
view. For example, you can create a custom scroll behavior that aligns to
every 10 points by doing the following:

### Paging Behavior

SwiftUI offers built in scroll behaviors. One such behavior is the
`PagingScrollTargetBehavior` which uses the geometry of the scroll view to
decide where to allow scrolls to end.

In the following example, every view in the lazy stack is flexible in both
directions and the scroll view will settle to container aligned boundaries.

### View Aligned Behavior

SwiftUI also offers a `ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior` scroll behavior that
will always settle on the geometry of individual views.

You configure which views should be used for settling using the
`scrollTargetLayout(isEnabled:)` modifier. Apply this modifier to a layout
container like `LazyVStack` or `HStack` and each individual view in that
layout will be considered for alignment.

Use types conforming to this protocol with the `scrollTargetBehavior(_:)`
modifier.

    struct ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior

## Overview

You use this behavior when a scroll view should always align its scroll
targets to a rectangle that’s aligned to the geometry of a view. In the
following example, the scroll view always picks an item view to settle on.

You configure which views should be used for settling using the
`scrollTargetLayout(isEnabled:)` modifier. Apply this modifier to a layout
container like `LazyVStack` or `HStack` and each individual view in that
layout will be considered for alignment.

You can customize whether the view aligned behavior limits the number of views
that can be scrolled at a time by using the
`ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.LimitBehavior` type. Provide a value of
`always` to always have the behavior only allow a few views to be scrolled at
a time.

By default, the view aligned behavior will limit the number of views it
scrolls when in a compact horizontal size class when scrollable in the
horizontal axis, when in a compact vertical size class when scrollable in the
vertical axis, and otherwise does not impose any limit on the number of views
that can be scrolled.

    @frozen
    enum ScrollTransitionPhase

## Overview

When a view with a scroll transition modifier applied is approaching the
visible region of the containing scroll view or other container, the effect
will first be applied with the `topLeading` or `bottomTrailing` phase
(depending on which edge the view is approaching), then will be moved to the
`identity` phase as the view moves into the visible area. The timing and
behavior that determines when a view is visible within the container is
controlled by the configuration that is provided to the `scrollTransition`
modifier.

In the `identity` phase, scroll transitions should generally not make any
visual change to the view they are applied to, since the transition’s view
modifications in the `identity` phase will be applied to the view as long as
it is visible. In the `topLeading` and `bottomTrailing` phases, transitions
should apply a change that will be animated to create the transition.

## Topics

### Getting the phase

`case identity`

The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is in the visible area.

`case topLeading`

The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is about to move into
the visible area at the top edge of a vertical scroll view, or the leading
edge of a horizont scroll view.

`case bottomTrailing`

The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is about to move into
the visible area at the bottom edge of a vertical scroll view, or the trailing
edge of a horizontal scroll view.

### Accessing the phase state

## Discussion

Use this modifier to hide or show scroll indicators on scrollable content in
views like a `ScrollView`, `List`, or `TextEditor`. This modifier applies the
prefered visibility to any scrollable content within a view hierarchy.

Use the `hidden` value to indicate that you prefer that views never show
scroll indicators along a given axis. Use `visible` when you prefer that views
show scroll indicators. Depending on platform conventions, visible scroll
indicators might only appear while scrolling. Pass `automatic` to allow views
to decide whether or not to show their indicators.

    func scrollClipDisabled(_ disabled: Bool = true) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`disabled`

    

A Boolean value that specifies whether to disable scroll view clipping.

## Return Value

A view that disables or enables scroll view clipping.

## Discussion

By default, a scroll view clips its content to its bounds, but you can disable
that behavior by using this modifier. For example, if the views inside the
scroll view have shadows that extend beyond the bounds of the scroll view, you
can use this modifier to avoid clipping the shadows:

The scroll view in the above example clips when the content view’s `disabled`
input is `false`, as it does if you omit the modifier, but not when the input
is `true`:

  * True 
  * False 

While you might want to avoid clipping parts of views that exceed the bounds
of the scroll view, like the shadows in the above example, you typically still
want the scroll view to clip at some point. Create custom clipping by using
the `clipShape(_:style:)` modifier to add a different clip shape. The
following code disables the default clipping and then adds rectangular
clipping that exceeds the bounds of the scroll view by the default padding
amount:

    func scrollDisabled(_ disabled: Bool) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`disabled`

    

A Boolean that indicates whether scrolling is disabled.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to control whether a `ScrollView` can scroll:

SwiftUI passes the disabled property through the environment, which means you
can use this modifier to disable scrolling for all scroll views within a view
hierarchy. In the following example, the modifier affects both scroll views:

You can also use this modifier to disable scrolling for other kinds of
scrollable views, like a `List` or a `TextEditor`.

    func scrollBounceBehavior(
        _ behavior: ScrollBounceBehavior,
        axes: Axis.Set = [.vertical]
    ) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`behavior`

    

The bounce behavior to apply to any scrollable views within the configured
view. Use one of the `ScrollBounceBehavior` values.

`axes`

    

The set of axes to apply `behavior` to. The default is `Axis.vertical`.

## Return Value

A view that’s configured with the specified scroll bounce behavior.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to indicate whether scrollable views bounce when people
scroll to the end of the view’s content, taking into account the relative
sizes of the view and its content. For example, the following `ScrollView`
only enables bounce behavior if its content is large enough to require
scrolling:

The modifier passes the scroll bounce mode through the `Environment`, which
means that the mode affects any scrollable views in the modified view
hierarchy. Provide an axis to the modifier to constrain the kinds of
scrollable views that the mode affects. For example, all the scroll views in
the following example can access the mode value, but only the two nested
scroll views are affected, because only they use horizontal scrolling:

You can use this modifier to configure any kind of scrollable view, including
`ScrollView`, `List`, `Table`, and `TextEditor`:

    func scrollDismissesKeyboard(_ mode: ScrollDismissesKeyboardMode) -> some View
    

##  Parameters

`mode`

    

The keyboard dismissal mode that scrollable content uses.

## Return Value

A view that uses the specified keyboard dismissal mode.

## Discussion

You use this modifier to customize how scrollable content interacts with the
software keyboard. For example, you can specify a value of `immediately` to
indicate that you would like scrollable content to immediately dismiss the
keyboard if present when a scroll drag gesture begins.

You can also use this modifier to customize the keyboard dismissal behavior
for other kinds of scrollable views, like a `List` or a `TextEditor`.

By default, a `TextEditor` is interactive while other kinds of scrollable
content always dismiss the keyboard on a scroll when linked against iOS 16 or
later. Pass a value of `never` to indicate that scrollable content should
never automatically dismiss the keyboard.

    static func interactive(timingCurve: UnitCurve = .easeInOut) -> ScrollTransitionConfiguration

##  Parameters

`timingCurve`

    

The curve that adjusts the pace at which the effect is interpolated between
phases of the transition. For example, an `.easeIn` curve causes interpolation
to begin slowly as the view reaches the edge of the scroll view, then speed up
as it reaches the visible threshold. The curve is applied ‘forward’ while the
view is appearing, meaning that time zero corresponds to the view being just
hidden, and time 1.0 corresponds to the pont at which the view reaches the
configuration threshold. This also means that the timing curve is applied in
reversed while the view is moving away from the center of the scroll view.

## Return Value

A configuration that interactively interpolates between transition phases
based on the current scroll position.

# ScrollViewProxy

Instance Method

# scrollTo(_:anchor:)

Scans all scroll views contained by the proxy for the first with a child view
with identifier `id`, and then scrolls to that view.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS

    func scrollTo<ID>(
        _ id: ID,
        anchor: UnitPoint? = nil
    ) where ID : Hashable

##  Parameters

`id`

    

The identifier of a child view to scroll to.

`anchor`

    

The alignment behavior of the scroll action.

## Discussion

If `anchor` is `nil`, this method finds the container of the identified view,
and scrolls the minimum amount to make the identified view wholly visible.

If `anchor` is non-`nil`, it defines the points in the identified view and the
scroll view to align. For example, setting `anchor` to `top` aligns the top of
the identified view to the top of the scroll view. Similarly, setting `anchor`
to `bottom` aligns the bottom of the identified view to the bottom of the
scroll view, and so on.

# StateObject

Initializer

# init(wrappedValue:)

Creates a new state object with an initial wrapped value.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    init(wrappedValue thunk: @autoclosure @escaping () -> ObjectType)

##  Parameters

`thunk`

    

An initial value for the state object.

## Discussion

You typically don’t call this initializer directly. Instead, SwiftUI calls it
for you when you declare a property with the `@StateObject` attribute in an
`App`, `Scene`, or `View` and provide an initial value:

SwiftUI creates only one instance of the state object for each container
instance that you declare. In the above code, SwiftUI creates `model` only the
first time it initializes a particular instance of `MyView`. On the other
hand, each instance of `MyView` creates a distinct instance of the data model.
For example, each of the views in the following `VStack` has its own model
storage:

### Initialize using external data

If the initial state of a state object depends on external data, you can call
this initializer directly. However, use caution when doing this, because
SwiftUI only initializes the object once during the lifetime of the view —
even if you call the state object initializer more than once — which might
result in unexpected behavior. For more information and an example, see
`StateObject`.

Instance Property

# wrappedValue

The underlying value referenced by the state object.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    @MainActor
    var wrappedValue: ObjectType { get }

## Discussion

The wrapped value property provides primary access to the value’s data.
However, you don’t typically access it directly. Instead, SwiftUI accesses
this property for you when you refer to the variable that you create with the
`@StateObject` attribute:

When you change a wrapped value, you can access the new value immediately.
However, SwiftUI updates views that display the value asynchronously, so the
interface might not update immediately.

### Getting the value

`var projectedValue: ObservedObject<ObjectType>.Wrapper`

A projection of the state object that creates bindings to its properties.

Instance Property

# projectedValue

A projection of the state object that creates bindings to its properties.

iOS 14.0+  iPadOS 14.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 14.0+  tvOS 14.0+  watchOS
7.0+  visionOS 1.0+

    
    
    @MainActor
    var projectedValue: ObservedObject<ObjectType>.Wrapper { get }

## Discussion

Use the projected value to get a `Binding` to a property of a state object. To
access the projected value, prefix the property name with a dollar sign (`$`).
For example, you can get a binding to a model’s `isEnabled` Boolean so that a
`Toggle` can control the value:
