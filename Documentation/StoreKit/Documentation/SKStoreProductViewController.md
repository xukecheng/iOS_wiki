Instance Method

# loadProduct(withParameters:completionBlock:)

Loads a new product screen to display.

iOS 6.0+  iPadOS 6.0+  macOS 11.0+  Mac Catalyst 13.0+

    
    
    func loadProduct(
        withParameters parameters: [String : Any],
        completionBlock block: ((Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void)? = nil
    )

##  Parameters

`parameters`

    

A dictionary describing the content you want the view controller to display.
See Product Dictionary Keys for keys that describe the product. See Ad network
install-validation keys for keys that describe an impression in an advertising
campaign.

`block`

    

A block to be called when the product information has been loaded from the App
Store. The completion block is called on the main thread and receives the
following parameters:

`result`

    

`true` if the product information was successfully loaded, otherwise `false`.

`error`

    

If an error occurred, this object describes the error. If the product
information was successfully loaded, this value is `nil`.

## Discussion

Concurrency Note

You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as
shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the
following declaration:

For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling
Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.

For a seamless user experience, load the product information before presenting
the `SKStoreProductViewController` view controller. However, if you load the
product information while presenting the view controller, once loaded, the
product data replaces the contents of the view controller.
