Type Property

# intents

The asynchronous sequence that emits a purchase intent when the user selects a
promoted in-app purchase on the App Store.

iOS 16.4+  iPadOS 16.4+  macOS 14.4+  Mac Catalyst 16.4+  Xcode 14.3+

    
    
    static var intents: PurchaseIntent.PurchaseIntents { get }

## Discussion

When a user selects to purchase a promoted product on the App Store, your app
receives a purchase intent. Use the `product` object to complete your appâ€™s
purchase workflow, including finishing the purchase, unlocking the product,
and any other workflow specific to your app.

The following example code receives the purchase intent, and calls a method to
complete the purchase workflow:

### Getting purchase intents

`struct PurchaseIntent.PurchaseIntents`

An asynchronous sequence of purchase intents for in-app purchases that users
initiate on the App Store.

Operator

# !=(_:_:)

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are not equal.

iOS 16.4+  iPadOS 16.4+  macOS 14.4+  Mac Catalyst 16.4+  Xcode 14.3+

    
    
    static func != (lhs: PurchaseIntent, rhs: PurchaseIntent) -> Bool

##  Parameters

`lhs`

    

A value to compare.

`rhs`

    

Another value to compare.

## Discussion

Inequality is the inverse of equality. For any values `a` and `b`, `a != b`
implies that `a == b` is `false`.

This is the default implementation of the not-equal-to operator (`!=`) for any
type that conforms to `Equatable`.
